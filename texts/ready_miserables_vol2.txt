what
is
met
with
on
the
way
from
nivelles
last
year
1861
on
a
beautiful
may
morning
a
traveller
the
person
who
is
telling
this
story
was
coming
from
nivelles
and
directing
his
course
towards
la
hulpe
he
was
on
foot
he
was
pursuing
a
broad
paved
road
which
undulated
between
two
rows
of
trees
over
the
hills
which
succeed
each
other
raise
the
road
and
let
it
fall
again
and
produce
something
in
the
nature
of
enormous
waves
he
had
passed
lillois
and
bois
seigneur
isaac
in
the
west
he
perceived
the
slate
roofed
tower
of
braine
l
alleud
which
has
the
form
of
a
reversed
vase
he
had
just
left
behind
a
wood
upon
an
eminence
and
at
the
angle
of
the
cross
road
by
the
side
of
a
sort
of
mouldy
gibbet
bearing
the
inscription
ancient
barrier
no
4
a
public
house
bearing
on
its
front
this
sign
at
the
four
winds
aux
quatre
vents
echabeau
private
cafe
a
quarter
of
a
league
further
on
he
arrived
at
the
bottom
of
a
little
valley
where
there
is
water
which
passes
beneath
an
arch
made
through
the
embankment
of
the
road
the
clump
of
sparsely
planted
but
very
green
trees
which
fills
the
valley
on
one
side
of
the
road
is
dispersed
over
the
meadows
on
the
other
and
disappears
gracefully
and
as
in
order
in
the
direction
of
braine
l
alleud
on
the
right
close
to
the
road
was
an
inn
with
a
four
wheeled
cart
at
the
door
a
large
bundle
of
hop
poles
a
plough
a
heap
of
dried
brushwood
near
a
flourishing
hedge
lime
smoking
in
a
square
hole
and
a
ladder
suspended
along
an
old
penthouse
with
straw
partitions
a
young
girl
was
weeding
in
a
field
where
a
huge
yellow
poster
probably
of
some
outside
spectacle
such
as
a
parish
festival
was
fluttering
in
the
wind
at
one
corner
of
the
inn
beside
a
pool
in
which
a
flotilla
of
ducks
was
navigating
a
badly
paved
path
plunged
into
the
bushes
the
wayfarer
struck
into
this
after
traversing
a
hundred
paces
skirting
a
wall
of
the
fifteenth
century
surmounted
by
a
pointed
gable
with
bricks
set
in
contrast
he
found
himself
before
a
large
door
of
arched
stone
with
a
rectilinear
impost
in
the
sombre
style
of
louis
xiv
flanked
by
two
flat
medallions
a
severe
facade
rose
above
this
door
a
wall
perpendicular
to
the
facade
almost
touched
the
door
and
flanked
it
with
an
abrupt
right
angle
in
the
meadow
before
the
door
lay
three
harrows
through
which
in
disorder
grew
all
the
flowers
of
may
the
door
was
closed
the
two
decrepit
leaves
which
barred
it
were
ornamented
with
an
old
rusty
knocker
the
sun
was
charming
the
branches
had
that
soft
shivering
of
may
which
seems
to
proceed
rather
from
the
nests
than
from
the
wind
a
brave
little
bird
probably
a
lover
was
carolling
in
a
distracted
manner
in
a
large
tree
the
wayfarer
bent
over
and
examined
a
rather
large
circular
excavation
resembling
the
hollow
of
a
sphere
in
the
stone
on
the
left
at
the
foot
of
the
pier
of
the
door
at
this
moment
the
leaves
of
the
door
parted
and
a
peasant
woman
emerged
she
saw
the
wayfarer
and
perceived
what
he
was
looking
at
it
was
a
french
cannon
ball
which
made
that
she
said
to
him
and
she
added
that
which
you
see
there
higher
up
in
the
door
near
a
nail
is
the
hole
of
a
big
iron
bullet
as
large
as
an
egg
the
bullet
did
not
pierce
the
wood
what
is
the
name
of
this
place
inquired
the
wayfarer
hougomont
said
the
peasant
woman
the
traveller
straightened
himself
up
he
walked
on
a
few
paces
and
went
off
to
look
over
the
tops
of
the
hedges
on
the
horizon
through
the
trees
he
perceived
a
sort
of
little
elevation
and
on
this
elevation
something
which
at
that
distance
resembled
a
lion
he
was
on
the
battle
field
of
waterloo
chapter
ii
hougomont
hougomont
this
was
a
funereal
spot
the
beginning
of
the
obstacle
the
first
resistance
which
that
great
wood
cutter
of
europe
called
napoleon
encountered
at
waterloo
the
first
knot
under
the
blows
of
his
axe
it
was
a
chateau
it
is
no
longer
anything
but
a
farm
for
the
antiquary
hougomont
is
hugomons
this
manor
was
built
by
hugo
sire
of
somerel
the
same
who
endowed
the
sixth
chaplaincy
of
the
abbey
of
villiers
the
traveller
pushed
open
the
door
elbowed
an
ancient
calash
under
the
porch
and
entered
the
courtyard
the
first
thing
which
struck
him
in
this
paddock
was
a
door
of
the
sixteenth
century
which
here
simulates
an
arcade
everything
else
having
fallen
prostrate
around
it
a
monumental
aspect
often
has
its
birth
in
ruin
in
a
wall
near
the
arcade
opens
another
arched
door
of
the
time
of
henry
iv
permitting
a
glimpse
of
the
trees
of
an
orchard
beside
this
door
a
manure
hole
some
pickaxes
some
shovels
some
carts
an
old
well
with
its
flagstone
and
its
iron
reel
a
chicken
jumping
and
a
turkey
spreading
its
tail
a
chapel
surmounted
by
a
small
bell
tower
a
blossoming
pear
tree
trained
in
espalier
against
the
wall
of
the
chapel
behold
the
court
the
conquest
of
which
was
one
of
napoleon
s
dreams
this
corner
of
earth
could
he
but
have
seized
it
would
perhaps
have
given
him
the
world
likewise
chickens
are
scattering
its
dust
abroad
with
their
beaks
a
growl
is
audible
it
is
a
huge
dog
who
shows
his
teeth
and
replaces
the
english
the
english
behaved
admirably
there
cooke
s
four
companies
of
guards
there
held
out
for
seven
hours
against
the
fury
of
an
army
hougomont
viewed
on
the
map
as
a
geometrical
plan
comprising
buildings
and
enclosures
presents
a
sort
of
irregular
rectangle
one
angle
of
which
is
nicked
out
it
is
this
angle
which
contains
the
southern
door
guarded
by
this
wall
which
commands
it
only
a
gun
s
length
away
hougomont
has
two
doors
the
southern
door
that
of
the
chateau
and
the
northern
door
belonging
to
the
farm
napoleon
sent
his
brother
jerome
against
hougomont
the
divisions
of
foy
guilleminot
and
bachelu
hurled
themselves
against
it
nearly
the
entire
corps
of
reille
was
employed
against
it
and
miscarried
kellermann
s
balls
were
exhausted
on
this
heroic
section
of
wall
bauduin
s
brigade
was
not
strong
enough
to
force
hougomont
on
the
north
and
the
brigade
of
soye
could
not
do
more
than
effect
the
beginning
of
a
breach
on
the
south
but
without
taking
it
the
farm
buildings
border
the
courtyard
on
the
south
a
bit
of
the
north
door
broken
by
the
french
hangs
suspended
to
the
wall
it
consists
of
four
planks
nailed
to
two
cross
beams
on
which
the
scars
of
the
attack
are
visible
the
northern
door
which
was
beaten
in
by
the
french
and
which
has
had
a
piece
applied
to
it
to
replace
the
panel
suspended
on
the
wall
stands
half
open
at
the
bottom
of
the
paddock
it
is
cut
squarely
in
the
wall
built
of
stone
below
of
brick
above
which
closes
in
the
courtyard
on
the
north
it
is
a
simple
door
for
carts
such
as
exist
in
all
farms
with
the
two
large
leaves
made
of
rustic
planks
beyond
lie
the
meadows
the
dispute
over
this
entrance
was
furious
for
a
long
time
all
sorts
of
imprints
of
bloody
hands
were
visible
on
the
door
posts
it
was
there
that
bauduin
was
killed
the
storm
of
the
combat
still
lingers
in
this
courtyard
its
horror
is
visible
there
the
confusion
of
the
fray
was
petrified
there
it
lives
and
it
dies
there
it
was
only
yesterday
the
walls
are
in
the
death
agony
the
stones
fall
the
breaches
cry
aloud
the
holes
are
wounds
the
drooping
quivering
trees
seem
to
be
making
an
effort
to
flee
this
courtyard
was
more
built
up
in
1815
than
it
is
to
day
buildings
which
have
since
been
pulled
down
then
formed
redans
and
angles
the
english
barricaded
themselves
there
the
french
made
their
way
in
but
could
not
stand
their
ground
beside
the
chapel
one
wing
of
the
chateau
the
only
ruin
now
remaining
of
the
manor
of
hougomont
rises
in
a
crumbling
state
disembowelled
one
might
say
the
chateau
served
for
a
dungeon
the
chapel
for
a
block
house
there
men
exterminated
each
other
the
french
fired
on
from
every
point
from
behind
the
walls
from
the
summits
of
the
garrets
from
the
depths
of
the
cellars
through
all
the
casements
through
all
the
air
holes
through
every
crack
in
the
stones
fetched
fagots
and
set
fire
to
walls
and
men
the
reply
to
the
grape
shot
was
a
conflagration
in
the
ruined
wing
through
windows
garnished
with
bars
of
iron
the
dismantled
chambers
of
the
main
building
of
brick
are
visible
the
english
guards
were
in
ambush
in
these
rooms
the
spiral
of
the
staircase
cracked
from
the
ground
floor
to
the
very
roof
appears
like
the
inside
of
a
broken
shell
the
staircase
has
two
stories
the
english
besieged
on
the
staircase
and
massed
on
its
upper
steps
had
cut
off
the
lower
steps
these
consisted
of
large
slabs
of
blue
stone
which
form
a
heap
among
the
nettles
half
a
score
of
steps
still
cling
to
the
wall
on
the
first
is
cut
the
figure
of
a
trident
these
inaccessible
steps
are
solid
in
their
niches
all
the
rest
resembles
a
jaw
which
has
been
denuded
of
its
teeth
there
are
two
old
trees
there
one
is
dead
the
other
is
wounded
at
its
base
and
is
clothed
with
verdure
in
april
since
1815
it
has
taken
to
growing
through
the
staircase
a
massacre
took
place
in
the
chapel
the
interior
which
has
recovered
its
calm
is
singular
the
mass
has
not
been
said
there
since
the
carnage
nevertheless
the
altar
has
been
left
there
an
altar
of
unpolished
wood
placed
against
a
background
of
roughhewn
stone
four
whitewashed
walls
a
door
opposite
the
altar
two
small
arched
windows
over
the
door
a
large
wooden
crucifix
below
the
crucifix
a
square
air
hole
stopped
up
with
a
bundle
of
hay
on
the
ground
in
one
corner
an
old
window
frame
with
the
glass
all
broken
to
pieces
such
is
the
chapel
near
the
altar
there
is
nailed
up
a
wooden
statue
of
saint
anne
of
the
fifteenth
century
the
head
of
the
infant
jesus
has
been
carried
off
by
a
large
ball
the
french
who
were
masters
of
the
chapel
for
a
moment
and
were
then
dislodged
set
fire
to
it
the
flames
filled
this
building
it
was
a
perfect
furnace
the
door
was
burned
the
floor
was
burned
the
wooden
christ
was
not
burned
the
fire
preyed
upon
his
feet
of
which
only
the
blackened
stumps
are
now
to
be
seen
then
it
stopped
a
miracle
according
to
the
assertion
of
the
people
of
the
neighborhood
the
infant
jesus
decapitated
was
less
fortunate
than
the
christ
the
walls
are
covered
with
inscriptions
near
the
feet
of
christ
this
name
is
to
be
read
henquinez
then
these
others
conde
de
rio
maior
marques
y
marquesa
de
almagro
habana
there
are
french
names
with
exclamation
points
a
sign
of
wrath
the
wall
was
freshly
whitewashed
in
1849
the
nations
insulted
each
other
there
it
was
at
the
door
of
this
chapel
that
the
corpse
was
picked
up
which
held
an
axe
in
its
hand
this
corpse
was
sub
lieutenant
legros
on
emerging
from
the
chapel
a
well
is
visible
on
the
left
there
are
two
in
this
courtyard
one
inquires
why
is
there
no
bucket
and
pulley
to
this
it
is
because
water
is
no
longer
drawn
there
why
is
water
not
drawn
there
because
it
is
full
of
skeletons
the
last
person
who
drew
water
from
the
well
was
named
guillaume
van
kylsom
he
was
a
peasant
who
lived
at
hougomont
and
was
gardener
there
on
the
18th
of
june
1815
his
family
fled
and
concealed
themselves
in
the
woods
the
forest
surrounding
the
abbey
of
villiers
sheltered
these
unfortunate
people
who
had
been
scattered
abroad
for
many
days
and
nights
there
are
at
this
day
certain
traces
recognizable
such
as
old
boles
of
burned
trees
which
mark
the
site
of
these
poor
bivouacs
trembling
in
the
depths
of
the
thickets
guillaume
van
kylsom
remained
at
hougomont
to
guard
the
chateau
and
concealed
himself
in
the
cellar
the
english
discovered
him
there
they
tore
him
from
his
hiding
place
and
the
combatants
forced
this
frightened
man
to
serve
them
by
administering
blows
with
the
flats
of
their
swords
they
were
thirsty
this
guillaume
brought
them
water
it
was
from
this
well
that
he
drew
it
many
drank
there
their
last
draught
this
well
where
drank
so
many
of
the
dead
was
destined
to
die
itself
after
the
engagement
they
were
in
haste
to
bury
the
dead
bodies
death
has
a
fashion
of
harassing
victory
and
she
causes
the
pest
to
follow
glory
the
typhus
is
a
concomitant
of
triumph
this
well
was
deep
and
it
was
turned
into
a
sepulchre
three
hundred
dead
bodies
were
cast
into
it
with
too
much
haste
perhaps
were
they
all
dead
legend
says
they
were
not
it
seems
that
on
the
night
succeeding
the
interment
feeble
voices
were
heard
calling
from
the
well
this
well
is
isolated
in
the
middle
of
the
courtyard
three
walls
part
stone
part
brick
and
simulating
a
small
square
tower
and
folded
like
the
leaves
of
a
screen
surround
it
on
all
sides
the
fourth
side
is
open
it
is
there
that
the
water
was
drawn
the
wall
at
the
bottom
has
a
sort
of
shapeless
loophole
possibly
the
hole
made
by
a
shell
this
little
tower
had
a
platform
of
which
only
the
beams
remain
the
iron
supports
of
the
well
on
the
right
form
a
cross
on
leaning
over
the
eye
is
lost
in
a
deep
cylinder
of
brick
which
is
filled
with
a
heaped
up
mass
of
shadows
the
base
of
the
walls
all
about
the
well
is
concealed
in
a
growth
of
nettles
this
well
has
not
in
front
of
it
that
large
blue
slab
which
forms
the
table
for
all
wells
in
belgium
the
slab
has
here
been
replaced
by
a
cross
beam
against
which
lean
five
or
six
shapeless
fragments
of
knotty
and
petrified
wood
which
resemble
huge
bones
there
is
no
longer
either
pail
chain
or
pulley
but
there
is
still
the
stone
basin
which
served
the
overflow
the
rain
water
collects
there
and
from
time
to
time
a
bird
of
the
neighboring
forests
comes
thither
to
drink
and
then
flies
away
one
house
in
this
ruin
the
farmhouse
is
still
inhabited
the
door
of
this
house
opens
on
the
courtyard
upon
this
door
beside
a
pretty
gothic
lock
plate
there
is
an
iron
handle
with
trefoils
placed
slanting
at
the
moment
when
the
hanoverian
lieutenant
wilda
grasped
this
handle
in
order
to
take
refuge
in
the
farm
a
french
sapper
hewed
off
his
hand
with
an
axe
the
family
who
occupy
the
house
had
for
their
grandfather
guillaume
van
kylsom
the
old
gardener
dead
long
since
a
woman
with
gray
hair
said
to
us
i
was
there
i
was
three
years
old
my
sister
who
was
older
was
terrified
and
wept
they
carried
us
off
to
the
woods
i
went
there
in
my
mother
s
arms
we
glued
our
ears
to
the
earth
to
hear
i
imitated
the
cannon
and
went
boum
boum
a
door
opening
from
the
courtyard
on
the
left
led
into
the
orchard
so
we
were
told
the
orchard
is
terrible
it
is
in
three
parts
one
might
almost
say
in
three
acts
the
first
part
is
a
garden
the
second
is
an
orchard
the
third
is
a
wood
these
three
parts
have

in

that
six
light
infantry
men
of

having
made
their
way
thither
and
being
unable
to
escape
hunted
down
and
caught
like

in

accepted
the
combat
with

as
the
principal
attack
came
from
that
quarter
the

is
hidden
on
the
outside
by
a
tall

the
french
came
up
thinking
that
they
had
to
deal
only
with
a
hedge
crossed
it
and
found
the
wall
both
an
obstacle

an
ambuscade

the
eighteenth
of
june
1815
let
us
turn
back
that
is
one
of
the
story
teller
s
rights
and
put
ourselves
once
more
in
the
year
1815
and
even
a
little
earlier
than
the
epoch
when
the
action
narrated
in
the
first
part
of
this
book
took
place
if
it
had
not
rained
in
the
night
between
the
17th
and
the
18th
of
june
1815
the
fate
of
europe
would
have
been
different
a
few
drops
of
water
more
or
less
decided
the
downfall
of
napoleon
all
that
providence
required
in
order
to
make
waterloo
the
end
of
austerlitz
was
a
little
more
rain
and
a
cloud
traversing
the
sky
out
of
season
sufficed
to
make
a
world
crumble
the
battle
of
waterloo
could
not
be
begun
until
half
past
eleven
o
clock
and
that
gave
blucher
time
to
come
up
why
because
the
ground
was
wet
the
artillery
had
to
wait
until
it
became
a
little
firmer
before
they
could
manoeuvre
napoleon
was
an
artillery
officer
and
felt
the
effects
of
this
the
foundation
of
this
wonderful
captain
was
the
man
who
in
the
report
to
the
directory
on
aboukir
said
such
a
one
of
our
balls
killed
six
men
all
his
plans
of
battle
were
arranged
for
projectiles
the
key
to
his
victory
was
to
make
the
artillery
converge
on
one
point
he
treated
the
strategy
of
the
hostile
general
like
a
citadel
and
made
a
breach
in
it
he
overwhelmed
the
weak
point
with
grape
shot
he
joined
and
dissolved
battles
with
cannon
there
was
something
of
the
sharpshooter
in
his
genius
to
beat
in
squares
to
pulverize
regiments
to
break
lines
to
crush
and
disperse
masses
for
him
everything
lay
in
this
to
strike
strike
strike
incessantly
and
he
intrusted
this
task
to
the
cannon
ball
a
redoubtable
method
and
one
which
united
with
genius
rendered
this
gloomy
athlete
of
the
pugilism
of
war
invincible
for
the
space
of
fifteen
years
on
the
18th
of
june
1815
he
relied
all
the
more
on
his
artillery
because
he
had
numbers
on
his
side
wellington
had
only
one
hundred
and
fifty
nine
mouths
of
fire
napoleon
had
two
hundred
and
forty
suppose
the
soil
dry
and
the
artillery
capable
of
moving
the
action
would
have
begun
at
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
battle
would
have
been
won
and
ended
at
two
o
clock
three
hours
before
the
change
of
fortune
in
favor
of
the
prussians
what
amount
of
blame
attaches
to
napoleon
for
the
loss
of
this
battle
is
the
shipwreck
due
to
the
pilot
was
it
the
evident
physical
decline
of
napoleon
that
complicated
this
epoch
by
an
inward
diminution
of
force
had
the
twenty
years
of
war
worn
out
the
blade
as
it
had
worn
the
scabbard
the
soul
as
well
as
the
body
did
the
veteran
make
himself
disastrously
felt
in
the
leader
in
a
word
was
this
genius
as
many
historians
of
note
have
thought
suffering
from
an
eclipse
did
he
go
into
a
frenzy
in
order
to
disguise
his
weakened
powers
from
himself
did
he
begin
to
waver
under
the
delusion
of
a
breath
of
adventure
had
he
become
a
grave
matter
in
a
general
unconscious
of
peril
is
there
an
age
in
this
class
of
material
great
men
who
may
be
called
the
giants
of
action
when
genius
grows
short
sighted
old
age
has
no
hold
on
the
geniuses
of
the
ideal
for
the
dantes
and
michael
angelos
to
grow
old
is
to
grow
in
greatness
is
it
to
grow
less
for
the
hannibals
and
the
bonapartes
had
napoleon
lost
the
direct
sense
of
victory
had
he
reached
the
point
where
he
could
no
longer
recognize
the
reef
could
no
longer
divine
the
snare
no
longer
discern
the
crumbling
brink
of
abysses
had
he
lost
his
power
of
scenting
out
catastrophes
he
who
had
in
former
days
known
all
the
roads
to
triumph
and
who
from
the
summit
of
his
chariot
of
lightning
pointed
them
out
with
a
sovereign
finger
had
he
now
reached
that
state
of
sinister
amazement
when
he
could
lead
his
tumultuous
legions
harnessed
to
it
to
the
precipice
was
he
seized
at
the
age
of
forty
six
with
a
supreme
madness
was
that
titanic
charioteer
of
destiny
no
longer
anything
more
than
an
immense
dare
devil
we
do
not
think
so
his
plan
of
battle
was
by
the
confession
of
all
a
masterpiece
to
go
straight
to
the
centre
of
the
allies
line
to
make
a
breach
in
the
enemy
to
cut
them
in
two
to
drive
the
british
half
back
on
hal
and
the
prussian
half
on
tongres
to
make
two
shattered
fragments
of
wellington
and
blucher
to
carry
mont
saint
jean
to
seize
brussels
to
hurl
the
german
into
the
rhine
and
the
englishman
into
the
sea
all
this
was
contained
in
that
battle
according
to
napoleon
afterwards
people
would
see
of
course
we
do
not
here
pretend
to
furnish
a
history
of
the
battle
of
waterloo
one
of
the
scenes
of
the
foundation
of
the
story
which
we
are
relating
is
connected
with
this
battle
but
this
history
is
not
our
subject
this
history
moreover
has
been
finished
and
finished
in
a
masterly
manner
from
one
point
of
view
by
napoleon
and
from
another
point
of
view
by
a
whole
pleiad
of
historians
7
as
for
us
we
leave
the
historians
at
loggerheads
we
are
but
a
distant
witness
a
passer
by
on
the
plain
a
seeker
bending
over
that
soil
all
made
of
human
flesh
taking
appearances
for
realities
perchance
we
have
no
right
to
oppose
in
the
name
of
science
a
collection
of
facts
which
contain
illusions
no
doubt
we
possess
neither
military
practice
nor
strategic
ability
which
authorize
a
system
in
our
opinion
a
chain
of
accidents
dominated
the
two
leaders
at
waterloo
and
when
it
becomes
a
question
of
destiny
that
mysterious
culprit

judge
like

was
at
the
centre
of
this

is
the
precise
point
where
the
final
word
of
the
battle
was
pronounced
it
was
there
that
the

been
placed

involuntary

of

the

let
the

picture
to
himself
a
vast
undulating
sweep
of
ground
each

commands
the
next
rise
and
all
the
undulations
mount
towards
mont
saint

and
there
end
in
the
forest
two
hostile
troops
on
a
field

two

it
is
a
question
of

one
seeks
to

they
clutch
at

angle

them

the
lack
of
a

under

cover
they
can
draw
up
a
regiment
yields
its

an
unevenness
in
the
ground
a
chance
turn
in
the
landscape
a
cross
path
encountered
at
the
right
moment
a
grove
a
ravine
can
stay
the
heel
of
that
colossus
which
is
called
an
army
and
prevent
its
retreat
he
who
quits
the
field
is
beaten
hence
the
necessity
devolving
on
the
responsible
leader
of
examining
the
most
insignificant
clump
of
trees
and
of
studying
deeply
the
slightest
relief
in
the
ground
the
two
generals
had
attentively
studied
the
plain
of
mont
saint
jean
now
called
the
plain
of
waterloo
in
the
preceding
year
wellington
with
the
sagacity
of
foresight
had
examined
it
as
the
possible
seat
of
a
great
battle
upon
this
spot
and
for
this
duel
on
the
18th
of
june
wellington
had
the
good
post
napoleon
the
bad
post
the
english
army
was
stationed

the
french
army
below
it
is
almost
superfluous
here
to
sketch
the
appearance
of
napoleon
on
horseback
glass
in
hand
upon
the
heights
of
rossomme
at
daybreak
on
june
18
1815
all
the
world
has
seen
him
before
we
can
show
him
that
calm
profile
under
the
little
three
cornered
hat
of
the
school
of
brienne
that
green
uniform
the
white
revers
concealing
the
star
of
the
legion
of
honor
his
great
coat
hiding
his
epaulets
the
corner
of
red
ribbon
peeping
from
beneath
his
vest
his
leather
trousers
the
white
horse
with
the
saddle
cloth
of
purple
velvet
bearing
on
the
corners
crowned
n
s
and
eagles
hessian
boots
over
silk
stockings
silver
spurs
the
sword
of
marengo
that
whole
figure
of
the
last
of
the
caesars
is
present
to
all
imaginations
saluted
with
acclamations
by
some
severely
regarded
by
others
that
figure
stood
for
a
long
time
wholly
in
the
light
this
arose
from
a
certain
legendary
dimness
evolved
by
the
majority
of
heroes
and
which
always
veils
the
truth
for
a
longer
or
shorter
time
but
to
day
history
and
daylight
have
arrived
that
light
called
history
is
pitiless
it
possesses
this
peculiar
and
divine
quality
that
pure
light
as
it
is
and
precisely
because
it
is
wholly
light
it
often
casts
a
shadow
in
places
where
people
had
hitherto
beheld
rays
from
the
same
man
it
constructs
two
different
phantoms
and
the
one
attacks
the
other
and
executes
justice
on
it
and
the
shadows
of
the
despot
contend
with
the
brilliancy
of
the
leader

arises

truer

v

the

phase
of

a
beginning
which
was
troubled
uncertain
hesitating
menacing
to

armies

still
more
so
for
the
english
than
for
the
french
it
had
rained
all

the

had
been
cut
up
by

downpour
the
water
had
accumulated
here
and
there
in

plain
as

in

at
some
points
the

late
napoleon
as
we
have
already
explained
was
in
the
habit
of
keeping
all
his
artillery
well
in
hand
like
a
pistol
aiming
it
now
at
one
point
now
at
another
of
the
battle
and
it
had
been
his
wish
to
wait
until
the
horse
batteries
could
move
and
gallop
freely
in
order
to
do
that
it
was
necessary
that
the
sun
should
come
out
and
dry
the
soil
but
the
sun
did
not
make
its
appearance
it
was
no
longer
the
rendezvous
of
austerlitz
when
the
first
cannon
was
fired
the
english
general
colville
looked
at
his
watch
and
noted
that
it
was
thirty
five
minutes
past
eleven
the
action
was
begun
furiously
with
more
fury
perhaps
than
the
emperor
would
have
wished
by
the
left
wing
of
the
french
resting
on
hougomont
at
the
same
time
napoleon
attacked
the
centre
by
hurling
quiot
s
brigade
on
la
haie
sainte
and
ney
pushed
forward
the
right
wing
of
the
french
against
the
left
wing
of
the
english
which
rested
on
papelotte
the
attack
on
hougomont
was
something
of
a
feint
the
plan
was
to
draw
wellington
thither
and
to
make
him
swerve
to
the
left
this
plan
would
have
succeeded
if
the
four
companies
of
the
english
guards
and
the
brave
belgians
of
perponcher
s
division
had
not
held
the
position
solidly
and
wellington
instead
of
massing
his
troops
there
could
confine
himself
to
despatching
thither
as
reinforcements
only
four
more
companies
of
guards
and
one
battalion
from
brunswick
the
attack
of
the
right
wing
of
the
french
on
papelotte
was
calculated
in
fact
to
overthrow
the
english
left
to
cut
off
the
road
to
brussels
to
bar
the
passage
against
possible
prussians
to
force
mont
saint
jean
to
turn
wellington
back
on
hougomont
thence
on
braine
l
alleud
thence
on
hal
nothing
easier
with
the
exception
of
a
few
incidents
this
attack
succeeded
papelotte
was
taken
la
haie
sainte
was
carried
a
detail
to
be
noted
there
was
in
the
english
infantry
particularly
in
kempt
s
brigade
a
great
many
raw
recruits
these
young
soldiers
were
valiant
in
the
presence
of
our
redoubtable
infantry
their
inexperience
extricated
them
intrepidly
from
the
dilemma
they
performed
particularly
excellent
service
as
skirmishers
the
soldier
skirmisher
left
somewhat
to
himself
becomes
so
to
speak
his
own
general
these
recruits
displayed
some
of
the
french
ingenuity
and
fury
this
novice
of
an
infantry
had
dash

displeased

after
the
taking
of

the

wavered
there
is
in
this
day
an
obscure
interval
from
mid
day
to
four
o

the
middle
portion
of
this
battle
is
almost
indistinct
and
participates
in
the
sombreness
of
the
hand

conflict
twilight
reigns
over
it

perceive

whatever

the

during

the

of
the

leaders
enter
into

become

thrown

such
a

let
us
add
that
there
is
a
certain
instant
when
the
battle
degenerates
into
a
combat
becomes
specialized
and
disperses
into
innumerable
detailed
feats
which
to
borrow
the
expression
of
napoleon
himself
belong
rather
to
the
biography
of
the
regiments
than
to
the
history
of
the
army
the
historian
has
in
this
case
the
evident
right
to
sum
up
the
whole
he
cannot
do
more
than
seize
the
principal
outlines
of
the
struggle
and
it
is
not
given
to
any
one
narrator
however
conscientious
he
may
be
to
fix
absolutely
the
form
of
that
horrible
cloud
which
is
called
a
battle
this
which
is
true
of
all
great
armed
encounters
is
particularly
applicable
to
waterloo
nevertheless
at
a

it
occupied
the

of

having
behind
it
the

and
in

of
it
the
slope
which
was
tolerably
steep
then
it
rested
on

stout
stone
dwelling
which
at
that
time
belonged
to
the
domain
of
nivelles
and
which
marks
the
intersection
of

so
robust
that
the

rebounded

it

to

the

batteries
had
discovered
nothing
of
it

had
returned
and
reported
to
napoleon
that
there
were
no
obstacles
except
the
two
barricades
which
barred
the
road
to
nivelles

to

adjoining

by

an

according
to
many
a

sight
of
the
long
line
of
the

fires
illuminating
the
whole

from

it
had
seemed
to
him
that
fate
to
whom
he
had
assigned
a
day
on
the
field
of
waterloo
was
exact
to
the
appointment
he
stopped
his
horse
and
remained
for
some
time
motionless
gazing
at
the
lightning
and
listening
to
the
thunder
and
this
fatalist
was
heard
to
cast
into
the
darkness
this
mysterious
saying
we
are
in
accord
napoleon
was
mistaken
they
were
no
longer
in
accord
he
took
not
a
moment
for
sleep
every
instant
of
that
night
was
marked
by
a
joy
for
him
he
traversed
the
line
of
the
principal
outposts
halting
here
and
there
to
talk
to
the
sentinels
at
half
past
two
near
the
wood
of
hougomont
he
heard
the
tread
of
a
column
on
the
march
he
thought
at
the
moment
that
it
was
a
retreat
on
the
part
of
wellington
he
said
it
is
the
rear
guard
of
the
english
getting
under
way
for
the
purpose
of
decamping
i
will
take
prisoners
the
six
thousand
english
who
have
just
arrived
at
ostend
he
conversed
expansively
he
regained
the
animation
which
he
had
shown
at
his
landing
on
the
first
of
march
when
he
pointed
out
to
the
grand
marshal
the
enthusiastic
peasant
of
the

and
cried
well

here
is
a
reinforcement
already
on

night
of

rallied
wellington
that
little

lesson
said
napoleon
the
rain
redoubled
in
violence
the
thunder
rolled
while
the
emperor
was
speaking
at
half
past
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
he
lost
one
illusion
officers
who
had
been
despatched
to
reconnoitre
announced
to
him
that
the
enemy
was
not
making
any
movement
nothing
was
stirring
not
a
bivouac
fire
had
been
extinguished
the
english
army
was
asleep
the
silence
on
earth
was
profound
the
only
noise
was
in
the
heavens
at
four
o
clock
a
peasant
was
brought
in
to
him
by
the
scouts
this
peasant
had
served
as
guide
to
a
brigade
of
english
cavalry
probably
vivian
s
brigade
which
was
on
its
way
to
take
up
a
position
in
the
village
of
ohain
at
the
extreme
left
at
five
o
clock
two
belgian
deserters
reported
to
him
that
they
had
just
quitted
their
regiment
and
that
the
english
army
was
ready
for
battle
so
much
the
better
exclaimed
napoleon
i
prefer
to
overthrow
them
rather
than
to
drive
them
back
in
the
morning
he
dismounted
in
the
mud
on
the
slope
which
forms
an
angle
with
the
plancenoit
road
had
a
kitchen
table
and
a
peasant
s
chair
brought
to
him
from
the
farm
of
rossomme
seated
himself
with
a
truss
of
straw
for
a
carpet
and
spread
out
on
the
table
the
chart
of
the
battle
field
saying
to
soult
as
he
did
so
a
pretty
checker
board
in
consequence
of
the
rains
during
the
night
the
transports
of
provisions
embedded
in
the
soft
roads
had
not
been
able
to
arrive
by
morning
the
soldiers
had
had
no
sleep
they
were
wet
and
fasting
this
did
not
prevent
napoleon
from
exclaiming
cheerfully
to
ney
we
have
ninety
chances
out
of
a
hundred
at
eight
o
clock
the
emperor
s
breakfast
was
brought
to
him
he
invited
many
generals
to
it
during
breakfast
it
was
said
that
wellington
had
been
to
a
ball
two
nights
before
in
brussels
at
the
duchess
of
richmond
s
and
soult
a
rough
man
of
war
with
a
face
of
an
archbishop
said
the
ball
takes
place
to
day
the
emperor
jested
with
ney
who
said
wellington
will
not
be
so
simple
as
to
wait
for
your
majesty
that
was
his
way
however
he
was
fond
of
jesting
says
fleury
de
chaboulon
a
merry
humor
was
at
the
foundation
of
his
character
says
gourgaud
he
abounded
in
pleasantries
which
were
more
peculiar
than
witty
says
benjamin
constant
these
gayeties
of
a
giant
are
worthy
of
insistence
it
was
he
who
called
his
grenadiers
his
grumblers
he
pinched
their
ears
he
pulled
their
mustaches
the
emperor
did
nothing
but
play
pranks
on
us
is
the
remark
of
one
of
them
during
the
mysterious
trip
from
the
island
of
elba
to
france
on
the
27th
of
february
on
the
open
sea
the
french
brig
of
war
le
zephyr
having
encountered
the
brig
l
inconstant
on
which
napoleon
was
concealed
and
having
asked
the
news
of
napoleon
from
l
inconstant
the
emperor
who
still
wore
in
his
hat
the
white
and
amaranthine
cockade
sown
with
bees
which
he
had
adopted
at
the
isle
of
elba
laughingly
seized
the
speaking
trumpet
and
answered
for
himself
the
emperor
is
well
a
man
who
laughs
like
that
is
on
familiar
terms
with
events
napoleon
indulged
in
many
fits
of
this
laughter
during
the
breakfast
at
waterloo
after
breakfast
he
meditated
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
two
generals
seated
themselves
on
the
truss
of
straw
pen
in
hand
and
their
paper
on
their
knees
and
the
emperor
dictated
to
them
the
order
of
battle
at
nine
o
clock
at
the
instant
when
the
french
army
ranged
in
echelons
and
set
in
motion
in
five
columns
had
deployed
the
divisions
in
two
lines
the
artillery
between
the
brigades
the
music
at
their
head
as
they
beat
the
march
with
rolls
on
the
drums
and
the
blasts
of
trumpets
mighty
vast
joyous
a
sea
of
casques
of
sabres
and
of
bayonets
on
the
horizon
the
emperor
was
touched
and
twice
exclaimed
magnificent
magnificent
between
nine
o
clock
and
half
past
ten
the
whole
army
incredible
as
it
may
appear
had
taken
up
its
position
and
ranged
itself
in
six
lines
forming
to
repeat
the
emperor
s
expression
the
figure
of
six
v
s
a
few
moments
after
the
formation
of
the
battle
array
in
the
midst
of
that
profound
silence
like
that
which
heralds
the
beginning
of
a
storm
which
precedes
engagements
the
emperor
tapped
haxo
on
the
shoulder
as
he
beheld
the
three
batteries
of
twelve
pounders
detached
by
his
orders
from
the
corps
of
erlon
reille
and
lobau
and
destined
to
begin
the
action
by
taking
mont
saint
jean
which
was
situated
at
the
intersection
of
the
nivelles
and
the
genappe
roads
and
said
to
him
there
are
four
and
twenty
handsome
maids
general
sure
of
the
issue
he
encouraged
with
a
smile
as
they
passed
before
him
the
company
of
sappers
of
the
first
corps
which
he
had
appointed
to
barricade
mont
saint
jean
as
soon
as
the
village
should
be
carried
all
this
serenity
had
been
traversed
by
but
a
single
word
of
haughty
pity
perceiving
on
his
left
at
a
spot
where
there
now
stands
a
large
tomb
those
admirable
scotch
grays
with
their
superb
horses
massing
themselves
he
said
it
is
a
pity
then
he
mounted
his
horse
advanced
beyond
rossomme
and
selected
for
his
post
of
observation
a
contracted
elevation
of
turf
to
the
right
of
the
road
from
genappe
to
brussels
which
was
his
second
station
during
the
battle
the
third
station
the
one
adopted
at
seven
o
clock
in
the
evening
between
la
belle
alliance
and
la
haie
sainte
is
formidable
it
is
a
rather
elevated
knoll
which
still
exists
and
behind
which
the
guard
was
massed
on
a
slope
of
the
plain
around
this
knoll
the
balls
rebounded
from
the
pavements
of
the
road
up
to
napoleon
himself
as
at
brienne
he
had
over
his
head
the
shriek
of
the
bullets
and
of
the
heavy
artillery
mouldy
cannon
balls
old
sword
blades
and
shapeless
projectiles
eaten
up
with
rust
were
picked
up
at
the
spot
where
his
horse
feet
stood
scabra
rubigine
a
few
years
ago
a
shell
of
sixty
pounds
still
charged
and
with
its
fuse
broken
off
level
with
the
bomb
was
unearthed
it
was
at
this
last
post
that
the
emperor
said
to
his
guide
lacoste
a
hostile
and
terrified
peasant
who
was
attached
to
the
saddle
of
a
hussar
and
who
turned
round
at
every
discharge
of
canister
and
tried
to
hide
behind
napoleon
fool
it
is
shameful
you
ll
get
yourself
killed
with
a
ball
in
the
back
he
who
writes
these
lines
has
himself
found
in
the
friable
soil
of
this
knoll
on
turning
over
the
sand
the
remains
of
the
neck
of
a
bomb
disintegrated
by
the
oxidization
of
six
and
forty
years
and
old
fragments
of
iron
which
parted
like
elder
twigs
between
the
fingers
every
one
is
aware
that
the
variously
inclined
undulations
of
the
plains
where
the
engagement
between
napoleon
and
wellington
took
place
are
no
longer
what
they
were
on
june
18
1815
by
taking
from
this
mournful
field
the
wherewithal
to
make
a
monument
to
it
its
real
relief
has
been
taken
away
and
history
disconcerted
no
longer
finds
her
bearings
there
it
has
been
disfigured
for
the
sake
of
glorifying
it
wellington
when
he
beheld
waterloo
once
more
two
years
later
exclaimed
they
have
altered
my
field
of
battle
where
the
great
pyramid
of
earth
surmounted
by
the
lion
rises
to
day
there
was
a
hillock
which
descended
in
an
easy
slope
towards
the
nivelles
road
but
which
was
almost
an
escarpment
on
the
side
of
the
highway
to
genappe
the
elevation
of
this
escarpment
can
still
be
measured
by
the
height
of
the
two
knolls
of
the
two
great
sepulchres
which
enclose
the
road
from
genappe
to
brussels
one
the
english
tomb
is
on
the
left
the
other
the
german
tomb
is
on
the
right
there
is
no
french
tomb
the
whole
of
that
plain
is
a
sepulchre
for
france
thanks
to
the
thousands
upon
thousands
of
cartloads
of
earth
employed
in
the
hillock
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
height
and
half
a
mile
in
circumference
the
plateau
of
mont
saint
jean
is
now
accessible
by
an
easy
slope
on
the
day
of
battle
particularly
on
the
side
of
la
haie
sainte
it
was
abrupt
and
difficult
of
approach
the
slope
there
is
so
steep
that
the
english
cannon
could
not
see
the
farm
situated
in
the
bottom
of
the
valley
which
was
the
centre
of
the
combat
on
the
18th
of
june
1815
the
rains
had
still
farther
increased
this
acclivity
the
mud
complicated
the
problem
of
the
ascent
and
the
men
not
only
slipped
back
but
stuck
fast
in
the
mire
along
the
crest
of
the
plateau
ran
a
sort
of
trench
whose
presence
it
was
impossible
for
the
distant
observer
to
divine
what
was
this
trench
let
us
explain
braine
l

is
a
belgian
village
ohain
is
another
these
villages
both
of
them
concealed
in
curves
of
the
landscape
are
connected
by
a
road
about
a
league
and
a
half
in
length
which
traverses
the
plain
along
its
undulating
level
and
often
enters
and
buries
itself
in
the
hills
like
a
furrow
which
makes
a
ravine
of
this
road
in
some
places
in
1815
as
at
the
present
day
this
road
cut
the
crest
of
the
plateau
of
mont
saint

between
the
two
highways
from

it
is
now
on

it
was
then
a
hollow

its
two
slopes
have
been
appropriated
for
the
monumental
hillock
this

was
and
still
is
a
trench
throughout

greater
portion
of

course
a
hollow

a

feet
in

whose
banks
being
too
steep

there
particularly
in

happened
here
the
road
was
so
narrow
at
the

entrance
that
a
passer

was
crushed
by
a
cart
as
is
proved
by

it
was

that
a

crushed
there
in

by
a

from

slope
as
is
stated
on

of
which
has

the
emperor
puts
a
question
to
the
guide
lacoste
so
on
the
morning
of
waterloo
napoleon
was
content
he
was
right
the
plan
of
battle
conceived
by
him
was
as
we
have
seen
really
admirable
the
battle
once
begun
its
very
various
changes
the
resistance
of
hougomont
the
tenacity
of

of

the

only
succeeding
in

all
these
stormy
incidents
passing
like
the
clouds
of
battle
before
napoleon
had
hardly
troubled
his
gaze
and
had
not
overshadowed
that
face
of
imperial
certainty
napoleon
was
accustomed
to
gaze
steadily
at
war
he
never
added
up
the
heart
rending
details
cipher
by
cipher
ciphers
mattered
little
to
him
provided
that
they
furnished
the
total
victory
he
was
not
alarmed
if
the
beginnings
did
go
astray
since
he
thought
himself
the
master
and
the
possessor
at
the
end
he
knew
how
to
wait
supposing
himself
to
be
out
of
the
question
and
he
treated
destiny
as
his
equal
he
seemed
to
say
to
fate
thou
wilt
not
dare
composed
half
of
light
and
half
of
shadow
napoleon
thought
himself
protected
in
good
and
tolerated
in
evil
he
had
or
thought
that
he
had
a
connivance
one
might
almost
say
a
complicity
of
events
in
his
favor
which
was
equivalent
to
the
invulnerability
of
antiquity
nevertheless
when
one
has
beresina
leipzig
and
fontainebleau
behind
one
it
seems
as
though
one
might
distrust
waterloo
a
mysterious
frown
becomes
perceptible
in
the
depths
of
the
heavens
at
the
moment
when
wellington
retreated
napoleon
shuddered
he
suddenly
beheld
the
table
land
of
mont
saint
jean
cleared
and
the
van
of
the
english
army
disappear
it
was
rallying
but
hiding
itself
the
emperor
half
rose
in
his
stirrups
the
lightning
of
victory
flashed
from
his
eyes
wellington
driven
into
a
corner
at
the
forest
of
soignes
and
destroyed
that
was
the
definitive
conquest
of
england
by
france
it
was
crecy
poitiers
malplaquet
and
ramillies
avenged
the
man
of
marengo
was
wiping
out
agincourt
so
the
emperor
meditating
on
this
terrible
turn
of
fortune
swept
his
glass
for
the
last
time
over
all
the
points
of
the
field
of
battle
his
guard
standing
behind
him
with
grounded
arms
watched
him
from
below
with
a
sort
of
religion
he
pondered
he
examined
the
slopes
noted
the
declivities
scrutinized
the
clumps
of
trees
the
square
of
rye
the
path
he
seemed
to
be
counting
each
bush
he
gazed
with
some
intentness
at
the
english
barricades
of
the
two
highways
two
large
abatis
of
trees
that
on
the
road
to
genappe
above
la
haie
sainte
armed
with
two
cannon
the
only
ones
out
of
all
the
english
artillery
which
commanded
the
extremity
of
the
field
of
battle
and
that
on
the
road
to
nivelles
where
gleamed
the
dutch
bayonets
of
chasse
s
brigade
near
this
barricade
he
observed
the
old
chapel
of
saint
nicholas
painted
white
which
stands
at
the
angle
of
the
cross
road
near
braine
l
alleud
he
bent
down
and
spoke
in
a
low
voice
to
the
guide
lacoste
the
guide
made
a
negative
sign
with
his
head
which
was
probably
perfidious
the
emperor
straightened
himself
up
and
fell
to
thinking
wellington
had
drawn
back
all
that
remained
to
do
was
to
complete
this
retreat
by
crushing
him
napoleon
turning
round
abruptly
despatched
an
express
at
full
speed
to
paris
to
announce
that
the
battle
was
won
napoleon
was
one
of
those
geniuses
from
whom
thunder
darts
he
had
just
found
his
clap
of
thunder
he
gave

formed

they
were

on

there
were
six

wore

without

and
cuirasses
of
beaten

with
horse
pistols
in
their
holsters
and
long
sabre

that
morning
the
whole
army
had
admired
them
when
at
nine
o
clock
with
braying
of
trumpets
and
all
the
music
playing
let
us
watch
o

the
safety
of
the
empire
they
had
come
in
a
solid
column
with
one
of
their
batteries
on
their
flank
another
in
their
centre
and
deployed
in
two
ranks
between
the
roads
to
genappe
and
frischemont
and
taken
up
their
position
for
battle
in
that
powerful
second
line
so
cleverly
arranged
by
napoleon
which
having
on
its
extreme
left
kellermann

and
on

the
emperor
s
orders
ney
drew
his
sword
and
placed
himself
at
their
head
the
enormous
squadrons
were
set
in
motion
then
a
formidable
spectacle
was
seen
all
their
cavalry
with
upraised
swords
standards
and
trumpets
flung
to
the
breeze
formed
in
columns
by
divisions
descended
by
a
simultaneous
movement
and
like
one
man
with
the
precision
of
a
brazen
battering
ram
which
is
effecting
a
breach
the
hill
of
la
belle
alliance
plunged
into
the
terrible
depths
in
which
so
many
men
had
already
fallen
disappeared
there
in
the
smoke
then
emerging
from
that
shadow
reappeared
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
still
compact
and
in
close
ranks
mounting
at
a
full
trot
through
a
storm
of
grape
shot
which
burst
upon
them
the
terrible
muddy
slope
of
the
table
land
of
mont
saint
jean
they
ascended
grave
threatening
imperturbable
in
the
intervals
between
the
musketry
and
the
artillery
their
colossal
trampling
was
audible
being
two
divisions
there
were
two
columns
of
them
wathier
s
division
held
the
right
delort
s
division
was
on
the
left
it
seemed
as
though
two
immense
adders
of
steel
were
to
be
seen
crawling
towards
the
crest
of
the
table
land
it
traversed
the
battle
like
a
prodigy
nothing
like
it
had
been
seen
since
the
taking
of
the
great
redoubt
of
the
muskowa
by
the
heavy
cavalry
murat
was
lacking
here
but
ney
was
again
present
it
seemed
as
though
that
mass
had
become
a
monster
and
had
but
one
soul
each
column
undulated
and
swelled
like
the
ring
of
a
polyp
they
could
be
seen
through
a
vast
cloud
of
smoke
which
was
rent
here
and
there
a
confusion
of
helmets
of
cries
of
sabres
a
stormy
heaving
of
the
cruppers
of
horses
amid
the
cannons
and
the
flourish
of
trumpets
a
terrible
and
disciplined
tumult
over
all
the
cuirasses
like
the
scales
on
the
hydra
these
narrations
seemed
to
belong
to
another
age
something
parallel
to
this
vision
appeared
no
doubt
in
the
ancient
orphic
epics
which
told
of
the
centaurs
the
old
hippanthropes
those
titans
with
human
heads
and
equestrian
chests
who
scaled
olympus
at
a
gallop
horrible
invulnerable
sublime
gods
and
beasts
odd

twenty
six
battalions
rode
to
meet
twenty
six
battalions
behind
the
crest
of
the
plateau
in
the
shadow
of
the
masked
battery
the
english
infantry
formed
into
thirteen
squares
two
battalions
to
the
square
in
two
lines
with
seven
in
the
first
line
six
in
the
second
the
stocks
of
their
guns
to
their
shoulders
taking
aim
at
that
which
was
on
the
point
of
appearing
waited
calm
mute
motionless
they
did
not
see
the
cuirassiers
and
the
cuirassiers
did
not
see
them
they
listened
to
the
rise
of
this
flood
of
men
they
heard
the
swelling
noise
of
three
thousand
horse
the
alternate
and
symmetrical
tramp
of
their
hoofs
at
full
trot
the
jingling
of
the
cuirasses
the
clang
of
the
sabres
and
a
sort
of
grand
and
savage
breathing
there
ensued
a
most
terrible
silence
then
all
at
once
a
long
file
of
uplifted
arms
brandishing
sabres
appeared
above
the
crest
and
casques
trumpets
and
standards
and
three
thousand
heads
with
gray
mustaches
shouting
vive
l
empereur
all
this
cavalry
debouched
on
the
plateau
and
it
was
like
the
appearance
of
an
earthquake
all
at
once
a
tragic
incident
on
the
english
left
on
our
right
the
head
of
the
column
of
cuirassiers
reared
up
with
a
frightful
clamor
on
arriving
at
the
culminating
point
of
the
crest
ungovernable
utterly
given
over
to
fury
and
their
course
of
extermination
of
the
squares
and
cannon
the
cuirassiers
had
just
caught
sight
of
a
trench
a
trench
between
them
and
the
english
it
was
the
hollow
road
of
ohain
it
was
a
terrible
moment
the
ravine
was
there
unexpected
yawning
directly
under
the
horses
feet
two
fathoms
deep
between
its
double
slopes
the
second
file
pushed
the
first
into
it
and
the
third
pushed
on
the
second
the
horses
reared
and
fell
backward
landed
on
their
haunches
slid
down
all
four
feet
in
the
air
crushing
and
overwhelming
the
riders
and
there
being
no
means
of
retreat
the
whole
column
being
no
longer
anything
more
than
a
projectile
the
force
which
had
been
acquired
to
crush
the
english
crushed
the
french
the
inexorable
ravine
could
only
yield
when
filled
horses
and
riders
rolled
there
pell
mell
grinding
each
other
forming
but
one
mass
of
flesh
in
this
gulf
when
this
trench
was
full
of
living
men
the
rest
marched
over
them
and
passed
on
almost
a
third
of
dubois
s
brigade
fell
into
that
abyss
this
began
the
loss
of
the
battle
a
local
tradition
which
evidently
exaggerates
matters
says
that
two
thousand
horses
and
fifteen
hundred
men
were
buried
in
the
hollow
road
of
ohain
this
figure
probably
comprises
all
the
other
corpses
which
were
flung
into
this
ravine
the
day
after
the
combat
let
us
note
in
passing
that
it
was
dubois
s
sorely
tried
brigade
which
an
hour
previously
making
a
charge
to
one
side
had
captured
the
flag
of
the
lunenburg
battalion
napoleon
before
giving
the
order
for
this
charge
of
milhaud
s
cuirassiers
had
scrutinized
the
ground
but
had
not
been
able
to
see
that
hollow
road
which
did
not
even
form
a
wrinkle
on
the
surface
of
the
plateau
warned
nevertheless
and
put
on
the
alert
by
the
little
white
chapel
which
marks
its
angle
of
junction
with
the
nivelles
highway
he
had
probably
put
a
question
as
to
the
possibility
of
an
obstacle
to
the
guide
lacoste
the
guide
had
answered
no
we
might
almost
affirm
that
napoleon
s
catastrophe
originated
in
that
sign
of
a
peasant
s
head
other
fatalities
were
destined
to
arise
was
it
possible
that
napoleon
should
have
won
that
battle
we
answer
no
why
because
of
wellington
because
of
blucher
no
because
of
god
bonaparte
victor
at
waterloo
that
does
not
come
within
the
law
of
the
nineteenth
century
another
series
of
facts
was
in
preparation
in
which
there
was
no
longer
any
room
for
napoleon
the
ill
will
of
events
had
declared
itself
long
before
it
was
time
that
this
vast
man
should
fall
the
excessive
weight
of
this
man
in
human
destiny
disturbed
the
balance
this
individual
alone
counted
for
more
than
a
universal
group
these
plethoras
of
all
human
vitality
concentrated
in
a
single
head
the
world
mounting
to
the
brain
of
one
man
this
would
be
mortal
to
civilization
were
it
to
last
the
moment
had
arrived
for
the
incorruptible
and
supreme
equity
to
alter
its
plan
probably
the
principles
and
the
elements
on
which
the
regular
gravitations
of
the
moral
as
of
the
material
world
depend
had
complained
smoking
blood
over
filled
cemeteries
mothers
in
tears
these
are
formidable
pleaders
when
the
earth
is
suffering
from
too
heavy
a
burden
there
are
mysterious
groanings
of
the
shades
to
which
the
abyss
lends
an
ear
napoleon
had
been
denounced
in
the
infinite
and
his
fall
had
been
decided
on
he
embarrassed
god
waterloo
is
not
a
battle
it
is
a
change
of

on
the
part

chapter

the

the
battery
was
unmasked
at
the
same
moment
with
the
ravine
sixty
cannons
and
the
thirteen
squares
darted
lightning
point
blank
on
the
cuirassiers
the
intrepid
general
delort
made
the
military
salute
to
the
english
battery
the
whole
of
the
flying
artillery
of
the
english
had
re
entered
the
squares
at
a
gallop
the
cuirassiers
had
not
had
even
the
time
for
a
halt
the
disaster
of
the
hollow
road
had
decimated
but
not
discouraged
them
they
belonged
to
that
class
of
men
who
when
diminished
in
number
increase
in
courage
wathier
s
column
alone
had
suffered
in
the
disaster
delort
s
column
which
ney
had
deflected
to
the
left
as
though
he
had
a
presentiment
of
an
ambush
had
arrived
whole
the
cuirassiers
hurled
themselves
on
the
english
squares
at
full
speed
with
bridles
loose
swords
in
their
teeth
pistols
in
fist
such
was
the
attack
there
are
moments
in
battles
in
which
the
soul
hardens
the
man
until
the
soldier
is
changed
into
a
statue
and
when
all
this
flesh
turns
into
granite
the
english
battalions
desperately
assaulted
did
not
stir
then
it
was
terrible
all
the
faces
of
the
english
squares
were
attacked
at
once
a
frenzied
whirl
enveloped
them
that
cold
infantry
remained
impassive
the
first
rank
knelt
and
received
the
cuirassiers
on
their
bayonets
the
second
ranks
shot
them
down
behind
the
second
rank
the
cannoneers
charged
their
guns
the
front
of
the
square
parted
permitted
the
passage
of
an
eruption
of
grape
shot
and
closed
again
the
cuirassiers
replied
by
crushing
them
their
great
horses
reared
strode
across
the
ranks
leaped
over
the
bayonets
and
fell
gigantic
in
the
midst
of
these
four
living
wells
the
cannon
balls
ploughed
furrows
in
these
cuirassiers
the
cuirassiers
made
breaches
in
the
squares
files
of
men
disappeared
ground
to
dust
under
the
horses
the
bayonets
plunged
into
the
bellies
of
these
centaurs
hence
a
hideousness
of
wounds
which
has
probably
never
been
seen
anywhere
else
the
squares
wasted
by
this
mad
cavalry
closed
up
their
ranks
without
flinching
inexhaustible
in
the
matter
of
grape
shot
they
created
explosions
in
their
assailants
midst
the
form
of
this
combat
was
monstrous
these
squares
were
no
longer
battalions
they
were
craters
those
cuirassiers
were
no
longer
cavalry
they
were
a
tempest
each
square
was
a
volcano
attacked
by
a
cloud
lava
contended
with
lightning
the
square
on
the
extreme
right
the
most
exposed
of
all
being
in
the
air
was
almost
annihilated
at
the
very
first
shock
lt
was
formed
of
the
75th
regiment
of
highlanders
the
bagpipe
player
in
the
centre
dropped
his
melancholy
eyes
filled
with
the
reflections
of
the
forests
and
the
lakes
in
profound
inattention
while
men
were
being
exterminated
around
him
and
seated
on
a
drum
with
his
pibroch
under
his
arm
played
the
highland
airs
these
scotchmen
died
thinking
of
ben
lothian
as
did
the
greeks
recalling
argos
the
sword
of
a
cuirassier
which
hewed
down
the
bagpipes
and
the
arm
which
bore
it
put
an
end
to
the
song
by
killing
the
singer
the
cuirassiers
relatively
few
in
number
and
still
further
diminished
by
the
catastrophe
of
the
ravine
had
almost
the
whole
english
army
against
them
but
they
multiplied
themselves
so
that
each
man
of
them
was
equal
to
ten
nevertheless
some
hanoverian
battalions
yielded
wellington
perceived
it
and
thought
of
his
cavalry
had
napoleon
at
that
same
moment
thought
of
his
infantry
he
would
have
won
the
battle
this
forgetfulness
was
his
great
and
fatal
mistake
all
at
once
the
cuirassiers
who
had
been
the
assailants
found
themselves
assailed
the
english
cavalry
was
at
their
back
before
them
two

behind

in

before
and
in

and
cavalry
had
to
face
all
sides
what
mattered
it
to
them
they
were
a
whirlwind
their
valor
was
something
indescribable
in
addition
to
this
they
had
behind
them
the
battery
which
was
still
thundering
it
was
necessary
that
it
should
be
so
or
they
could
never
have
been
wounded

for

nothing
less
than
such

was
needed
it
was
no
longer
a

conflict
it
was
a
shadow
a
fury
a
dizzy
transport
of
souls
and
courage
a
hurricane
of

in
an

the

recaptured
captured

the
cuirassiers
quitted
the
cavalry
to
return
to
the
infantry
or
to
put
it
more
exactly
the
whole
of
that
formidable
rout
collared
each

without
releasing
the

still
held
firm
there
were
a
dozen
assaults
ney

half
the
cuirassiers
remained
on
the
plateau
this
conflict
lasted
two
hours
the
english
army
was
profoundly
shaken
there
is
no
doubt
that
had
they
not
been
enfeebled
in
their
first
shock
by
the
disaster
of
the
hollow
road
the
cuirassiers
would
have
overwhelmed

bore
to
the
emperor
in
front
of
the
farm
of
la
belle
alliance
wellington
s
situation
had
grown
worse
this
strange
battle
was
like
a
duel
between
two
raging
wounded
men
each
of
whom
still
fighting
and
still
resisting
is
expending
all
his
blood
which
of
the
two
will
be
the
first
to
fall
the
conflict
on
the
plateau
continued
what
had
become
of
the
cuirassiers
no
one
could
have
told
one
thing
is
certain
that
on
the
day
after
the
battle
a
cuirassier
and
his
horse
were
found
dead
among
the
woodwork
of
the
scales
for
vehicles
at
mont
saint
jean
at
the
very
point
where
the
four
roads
from
nivelles
genappe
la
hulpe
and
brussels
meet
and
intersect
each
other
this
horseman
had
pierced
the
english
lines
one
of
the
men
who
picked
up
the
body
still
lives
at
mont
saint
jean
his
name
is
dehaze
he
was
eighteen
years
old
at
that
time
wellington
felt
that
he
was
yielding
the
crisis
was
at
hand
the
cuirassiers
had
not
succeeded
since
the
centre
was
not
broken
through
as
every
one
was
in
possession
of
the
plateau
no
one
held
it
and
in
fact
it
remained
to
a
great
extent
with
the
english
wellington
held
the
village
and
the
culminating
plain
ney
had
only
the
crest
and
the
slope
they
seemed
rooted
in
that
fatal
soil
on
both
sides
but
the
weakening
of
the
english
seemed
irremediable
the
bleeding
of
that
army
was
horrible
kempt
on
the
left
wing
demanded
reinforcements
there
are
none
replied
wellington
he
must
let
himself

napoleon
exclaimed

where

does

nevertheless
the
english

was
in

worse

of

two
the
furious
onsets
of
those

with

to
the
testimony

witnesses
who

alive

such
that

these

exaggerating

goes
so

to

that

the
painful
surprise
of

is
well
known
grouchy
hoped
for
blucher
arriving
death
instead
of
life
fate
has
these
turns
the
throne
of
the
world
was
expected
it
was
saint
helena
that
was
seen
if
the
little
shepherd
who
served
as
guide
to
bulow
blucher
s
lieutenant
had
advised
him
to
debouch
from
the
forest
above
frischemont
instead
of
below
plancenoit
the
form
of
the
nineteenth
century
might
perhaps
have
been
different
napoleon
would
have
won
the
battle
of
waterloo
by
any
other
route
than
that
below
plancenoit
the
prussian
army
would
have
come
out
upon
a
ravine
impassable
for
artillery
and
bulow
would
not
have
arrived
now
the
prussian
general
muffling
declares
that
one
hour
s
delay
and
blucher
would
not
have
found
wellington
on
his
feet
the
battle
was
lost
it
was
time
that
bulow
should
arrive
as
will
be
seen
he
had
moreover
been
very
much
delayed
he
had
bivouacked
at
dion
le
mont
and
had
set
out
at
daybreak
but
the
roads
were
impassable
and
his
divisions
stuck
fast
in
the
mire
the
ruts
were
up
to
the
hubs
of
the
cannons
moreover
he
had
been
obliged
to
pass
the
dyle
on
the
narrow
bridge
of
wavre
the
street
leading
to
the
bridge
had
been
fired
by
the
french
so
the
caissons
and
ammunition
wagons
could
not
pass
between
two
rows
of
burning
houses
and
had
been
obliged
to
wait
until
the
conflagration
was
extinguished
it
was
mid
day
before
bulow
s
vanguard
had
been
able
to
reach
chapelle
saint
lambert
had
the
action
been
begun
two
hours
earlier
it
would
have
been
over
at
four
o
clock
and
blucher
would
have
fallen
on
the
battle
won
by
napoleon
such
are
these
immense
risks
proportioned
to
an
infinite
which
we
cannot
comprehend
the
emperor
had
been
the
first
as
early
as
mid
day
to
descry
with
his
field
glass
on
the
extreme
horizon
something
which
had
attracted
his
attention
he
had
said
i
see
yonder
a
cloud
which
seems
to
me
to
be
troops
then
he
asked
the
duc
de
dalmatie
soult
what
do
you
see
in
the
direction
of
chapelle
saint
lambert
the
marshal
levelling
his
glass
answered
four
or
five
thousand
men
sire
evidently
grouchy
but
it
remained
motionless
in
the
mist
all
the
glasses
of
the
staff
had
studied
the
cloud
pointed
out
by
the
emperor
some
said
it
is
trees
the
truth
is
that
the
cloud
did
not
move
the
emperor
detached
domon
s
division
of
light
cavalry
to
reconnoitre
in
that
quarter
bulow
had
not
moved
in
fact
his
vanguard
was
very
feeble
and
could
accomplish
nothing
he
was
obliged
to
wait
for
the
body
of
the
army
corps
and
he
had
received
orders
to
concentrate
his
forces
before
entering
into
line
but
at
five
o
clock
perceiving
wellington
s
peril
blucher
ordered
bulow
to
attack
and
uttered
these
remarkable
words
we
must
give
air
to
the
english
army
a
little
later
the
divisions
of
losthin
hiller
hacke

ryssel
deployed
before
lobau

the
cavalry
of
prince
william

debouched
from

hurled
themselves

and
the

carnage
began
in

darkness
the

felt
the

losing

around

in

vast
shock
of
the

it
heard
the
desperate

pausing
breathless
for

in

listened
in
the

to
that
gloomy
and
ever
decreasing
thunder
when
this
legion
had
been
reduced
to
a
handful
when
nothing
was
left
of
their
flag
but
a
rag
when
their
guns
the
bullets
all
gone
were
no

anything
but
clubs
when
the
heap
of
corpses
was
larger
than
the
group
of
survivors
there
reigned
among
the
conquerors
around
those
men
dying
so
sublimely
a
sort
of
sacred
terror
and
the
english
artillery
taking

became
silent
this
furnished
a
sort
of
respite
these

had
around

something
in
the
nature

a
swarm
of
spectres
silhouettes
of

on

the
black
profiles
of

the
white

viewed
through

the

through
the

in
the
depths
of

advanced
upon

gazed
at

through

of

could
hear

if
any

object
to
having
his

one
would
have
to
refrain
from
repeating
in
his
presence
what
is
perhaps
the
finest
reply
that
a

ever
made
this
would
enjoin
us
from
consigning
something
sublime
to

at

let
us
violate
this
injunction
now

among
those

there
was
one

cambronne
to
make
that
reply
and
then

what
could
be

for
being

is
the

as
to

it

not
this

the

hurls
not

at

the
implacable
rancor

of

the
superb
thing
about
england
there
no
offence
to
her
was
herself
it
was
not
her
captain
it
was
her

wellington
oddly
ungrateful
declares
in
a
letter
to
lord
bathurst
that
his
army
the
army
which
fought
on
the
18th
of
june
1815
was
a
detestable
army
what
does
that
sombre
intermingling
of
bones
buried
beneath
the
furrows
of
waterloo
think
of
that
england
has
been
too
modest
in
the
matter
of
wellington
to
make
wellington
so
great
is
to
belittle
england
wellington
is
nothing
but
a
hero
like
many
another
those
scotch
grays
those
horse
guards
those
regiments
of
maitland
and
of
mitchell
that
infantry
of
pack
and
kempt
that
cavalry
of
ponsonby
and
somerset
those
highlanders
playing
the
pibroch
under
the
shower
of
grape
shot
those
battalions
of

those
utterly
raw
recruits
who
hardly
knew
how
to
handle
a
musket
holding
their
own
against
essling
s
and
rivoli

old
troops
that
is
what
was
grand
wellington
was
tenacious
in
that
lay
his
merit
and
we
are
not
seeking
to
lessen
it
but
the
least
of
his
foot
soldiers
and
of
his
cavalry
would
have
been
as
solid
as
he
the
iron
soldier
is
worth
as
much
as
the
iron
duke
as
for
us
all
our
glorification
goes
to
the
english
soldier
to
the
english
army
to
the
english
people
if
trophy
there
be
it
is
to
england
that
the
trophy
is
due
the
column
of
waterloo
would
be
more
just
if
instead
of
the
figure
of
a
man
it
bore
on
high
the
statue
of
a
people
but
this
great
england
will
be
angry
at
what
we
are
saying
here
she
still
cherishes
after
her
own
1688
and
our
1789
the
feudal
illusion
she
believes
in

and
hierarchy
this
people
surpassed

as

for

it

it

it

that
at

a

the

could
not

in

that
which
we
admire
above

in

of

the

let
us
say
it
plainly
it
was
more
of
a
massacre
than
of
a

the

it

is
waterloo
to
be
considered
good
there
exists
a
very
respectable
liberal
school
which
does
not
hate
waterloo
we
do
not

to
it
to
us
waterloo
is
but
the
stupefied
date
of
liberty
that
such
an
eagle
should
emerge
from
such
an
egg
is
certainly
unexpected
if
one
places
one
s
self
at
the
culminating
point
of
view
of
the
question
waterloo
is
intentionally
a
counter
revolutionary
victory
it
is
europe
against
france
it
is
petersburg
berlin
and
vienna
against
paris
it
is
the
statu

against
the
initiative
it
is
the
14th
of
july
1789
attacked
through
the
20th
of
march
1815
it
is
the
monarchies
clearing
the
decks
in

to
the
indomitable
french
rioting
the
final
extinction
of
that
vast
people
which
had
been
in

was
the
dream
the
solidarity
of
the
brunswicks
the
nassaus
the
romanoffs
the
hohenzollerns
the
hapsburgs
with
the
bourbons
waterloo
bears
divine
right
on
its
crupper
it
is
true
that
the
empire
having
been
despotic
the
kingdom
by
the
natural
reaction
of
things
was
forced
to
be
liberal
and
that
a
constitutional
order
was
the
unwilling
result
of
waterloo
to
the
great
regret
of
the
conquerors
it
is
because
revolution
cannot
be
really
conquered
and
that
being
providential
and
absolutely
fatal
it
is
always
cropping
up
afresh
before
waterloo
in
bonaparte
overthrowing
the
old
thrones
after
waterloo
in

granting
and

to

countersigns
the
declaration
of
the
rights
of
man
if
you
wish
to
gain
an
idea
of
what
revolution
is
call
it
progress
and
if
you
wish
to
acquire
an
idea
of
the
nature
of
progress
call
it
to

to
morrow
fulfils
its
work
irresistibly
and
it
is
already
fulfilling
it
to
day
it
always
reaches
its
goal
strangely
it
employs
wellington
to
make
of
foy
who
was
only
a
soldier
an
orator
foy
falls
at
hougomont
and
rises
again
in

thus
does
progress
proceed
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
bad
tool
for
that
workman
it
does
not
become
disconcerted
but
adjusts
to
its
divine
work
the
man
who
has
bestridden
the

and
the
good
old
tottering
invalid
of

of

as
well
as
of

of

conqueror
without
of

within
waterloo
by
cutting
short
the
demolition
of
european

by

had
no
other
effect
than
to
cause
the
revolutionary
work
to
be
continued
in
another
direction
the
slashers
have
finished
it
was
the
turn
of
the
thinkers
the
century
that
waterloo
was
intended
to
arrest
has
pursued
its
march
that
sinister
victory
was
vanquished
by
liberty
in
short
and
incontestably
that
which
triumphed
at
waterloo
that
which
smiled
in
wellington
s
rear
that
which
brought
him
all
the
marshals
staffs
of
europe
including
it
is
said
the
staff
of
a
marshal
of
france
that
which
joyously
trundled
the
barrows
full
of

to
erect
the
knoll
of
the

that
which
triumphantly
inscribed
on

pedestal
the
date

that
which
encouraged
blucher
as
he
put
the
flying
army
to
the
sword
that
which
from
the
heights
of
the
plateau
of
mont
saint
jean
hovered
over
france
as
over
its
prey
was
the
counter
revolution
it
was
the
counter
revolution
which
murmured
that
infamous
word
dismemberment
on
arriving
in
paris
it
beheld
the
crater
close
at
hand
it
felt
those
ashes
which
scorched
its
feet
and
it
changed
its
mind
it
returned
to
the
stammer
of
a

let
us
behold
in
waterloo
only
that
which
is
in
waterloo
of
intentional
liberty
there
is
none
the
counter
revolution
was
involuntarily
liberal
in
the

manner
as
by
a
corresponding
phenomenon

was
involuntarily

the
sixty

had
fallen
on

were
quietly
rotting

something
of

was
shed
abroad

off
all
the

we

who
flatter
war
when
the

itself
we
tell
the
truth
about

war
has
frightful
beauties
which
we
have
not
concealed
it
has
also
we
acknowledge
some
hideous
features
one
of
the
most
surprising
is
the
prompt
stripping
of
the
bodies
of
the
dead
after
the
victory
the
dawn
which
follows
a
battle
always
rises
on
naked
corpses
who
does
this
who
thus
soils
the
triumph
what
hideous
furtive
hand
is
that
which
is
slipped
into
the
pocket
of
victory
what
pickpockets
are
they
who
ply
their
trade
in
the
rear
of
glory
some
philosophers
voltaire
among
the
number
affirm
that
it
is
precisely
those
persons
have
made

it
is

same
men
they
say
there
is
no
relief

who
are

those
who
are

the
hero
of
the
day
is
the
vampire
of
the
night
one
has
assuredly
the
right
after
all
to
strip
a
corpse
a
bit
when
one
is
the
author
of
that
corpse
for
our
own
part
we
do
not
think
so
it
seems
to
us
impossible
that
the
same
hand
should
pluck
laurels
and
purloin
the
shoes
from
a
dead
man
one
thing
is
certain
which
is
that
generally
after
conquerors
follow
thieves
but
let
us
leave
the
soldier
especially
the
contemporary
soldier
out
of
the
question
every
army
has
a
rear
guard
and
it
is
that
which
must
be
blamed
bat
like
creatures
half
brigands
and
lackeys
all
the
sorts
of
vespertillos
that
that
twilight
called
war
engenders
wearers
of
uniforms
who
take
no
part
in
the
fighting
pretended
invalids
formidable
limpers
interloping
sutlers
trotting
along
in
little
carts
sometimes
accompanied
by
their
wives
and
stealing
things
which
they
sell
again
beggars
offering
themselves
as
guides
to
officers
soldiers
servants
marauders
armies
on
the
march
in
days
gone
by
we
are
not
speaking
of
the
present
dragged
all
this
behind
them
so
that
in
the
special
language
they
are
called
stragglers
no
army
no
nation
was
responsible
for
those
beings
they
spoke
italian
and
followed
the
germans
then
spoke
french
and
followed
the
english
it
was
by
one
of
these
wretches
a
spanish
straggler
who
spoke
french
that
the
marquis
of
fervacques
deceived
by
his
picard
jargon
and
taking
him
for
one
of
our
own
men
was
traitorously
slain
and
robbed
on
the
battle
field
itself
in
the
course
of
the
night
which
followed
the
victory
of
cerisoles
the
rascal
sprang
from
this
marauding
the
detestable
maxim
live
on
the
enemy
produced
this
leprosy
which
a
strict
discipline
alone
could
heal
there
are
reputations
which
are
deceptive
one
does
not
always
know
why
certain
generals
great
in
other
directions
have
been
so
popular
turenne
was
adored
by
his
soldiers
because
he
tolerated
pillage
evil
permitted
constitutes
part
of
goodness
turenne
was
so
good
that
he
allowed
the
palatinate
to
be
delivered
over
to
fire
and
blood
the
marauders
in
the
train
of
an
army
were
more
or
less
in
number
according
as
the
chief
was
more
or
less
severe
hoche
and
marceau
had
no
stragglers
wellington
had
few
and
we
do
him
the
justice
to
mention
it
nevertheless
on
the
night
from
the
18th
to
the
19th
of
june
the
dead
were
robbed
wellington
was
rigid
he
gave
orders
that
any
one
caught
in
the
act
should
be
shot
but
rapine
is
tenacious
the
marauders
stole
in
one
corner
of
the
battlefield
while
others
were
being
shot
in
another
the
moon
was
sinister
over
this
plain
towards
midnight
a
man
was
prowling
about
or
rather
climbing
in
the
direction
of
the
hollow
road
of
ohain
to
all
appearance
he
was
one
of
those
whom
we
have
just
described
neither
english
nor
french
neither
peasant
nor
soldier
less
a
man
than
a
ghoul
attracted
by
the
scent
of
the
dead
bodies
having
theft
for
his
victory
and
come
to
rifle
waterloo
he
was
clad
in
a
blouse
that
was
something
like
a
great
coat
he
was
uneasy
and
audacious
he
walked
forwards
and
gazed
behind
him
who
was
this
man
the
night
probably
knew
more
of
him
than
the
day
he
had
no
sack
but
evidently
he
had
large
pockets
under
his
coat
from
time
to
time
he
halted
scrutinized
the
plain
around
him
as
though
to
see
whether
he
were
observed
bent
over
abruptly
disturbed
something
silent
and
motionless
on
the
ground
then
rose
and
fled
his
sliding
motion
his
attitudes
his
mysterious
and
rapid
gestures
caused
him
to
resemble
those
twilight
larvae
which
haunt
ruins
and
which
ancient
norman
legends
call
the
alleurs
certain
nocturnal
wading
birds
produce
these
silhouettes
among
the
marshes
a
glance
capable
of
piercing
all
that
mist
deeply
would
have
perceived
at
some
distance
a
sort
of
little
sutler
s
wagon
with
a
fluted
wicker
hood
harnessed
to
a
famished
nag
which
was
cropping
the
grass
across
its
bit
as
it
halted
hidden
as
it
were
behind
the
hovel
which
adjoins
the
highway
to
nivelles
at
the
angle
of
the
road
from
mont
saint
jean
to
braine
l
alleud
and
in
the
wagon
a
sort
of
woman
seated
on
coffers
and
packages
perhaps
there
was
some
connection
between
that
wagon
and
that
prowler
the
darkness
was
serene
not
a
cloud
in
the
zenith
what
matters
it
if
the
earth
be
red
the
moon
remains
white
these
are
the
indifferences
of
the
sky
in
the
fields
branches
of
trees
broken
by
grape
shot
but
not
fallen
upheld
by
their
bark
swayed
gently
in
the
breeze
of
night
a
breath
almost
a
respiration
moved
the
shrubbery
quivers
which
resembled
the
departure
of
souls
ran
through
the
grass
in
the
distance
the
coming
and
going
of
patrols
and
the
general
rounds
of
the
english
camp
were
audible
hougomont
and
la
haie
sainte
continued
to
burn
forming
one
in
the
west
the
other
in
the
east
two
great
flames
which
were
joined
by
the
cordon
of
bivouac
fires
of
the
english
like
a
necklace
of
rubies
with
two
carbuncles
at
the
extremities
as
they
extended
in
an
immense
semicircle
over
the
hills
along
the
horizon
we
have
described
the
catastrophe
of
the
road
of
ohain
the
heart
is
terrified
at
the
thought
of
what
that
death
must
have
been
to
so
many
brave
men
if
there
is
anything
terrible
if
there
exists
a
reality
which
surpasses
dreams
it
is
this
to
live
to
see
the
sun
to
be
in
full
possession
of
virile
force
to
possess
health
and
joy
to
laugh
valiantly
to
rush
towards
a
glory
which
one
sees
dazzling
in
front
of
one
to
feel
in
one
s
breast
lungs
which
breathe
a
heart
which
beats
a
will
which
reasons
to
speak
think
hope
love
to
have
a
mother
to
have
a
wife
to
have
children
to
have
the
light
and
all
at
once
in
the
space
of
a
shout
in
less
than
a
minute
to
sink
into
an
abyss
to
fall
to
roll
to
crush
to
be
crushed
to
see
ears
of
wheat
flowers
leaves
branches
not
to
be
able
to
catch
hold
of
anything
to
feel
one
s
sword
useless
men
beneath
one
horses
on
top
of
one
to
struggle
in
vain
since
one
s
bones
have
been
broken
by
some
kick
in
the
darkness
to
feel
a
heel
which
makes
one
s
eyes
start
from
their
sockets
to
bite
horses
shoes
in
one
s
rage
to
stifle
to
yell
to
writhe
to
be
beneath
and
to
say
to
one
s
self
but
just
a
little
while
ago
i
was
a
living
man
there
where
that
lamentable
disaster
had
uttered
its
death
rattle
all
was
silence
now
the
edges
of
the
hollow
road
were
encumbered
with
horses
and
riders
inextricably
heaped
up
terrible
entanglement
there
was
no
longer
any
slope
for
the
corpses
had
levelled
the
road
with
the
plain
and
reached
the
brim
like
a
well
filled
bushel
of
barley
a
heap
of
dead
bodies
in
the
upper
part
a
river
of
blood
in
the
lower
part
such
was
that
road
on
the
evening
of
the
18th
of
june
1815
the
blood
ran
even
to
the
nivelles
highway
and
there
overflowed
in
a
large
pool
in
front
of
the
abatis
of
trees
which
barred
the
way
at
a
spot
which
is
still
pointed
out
it
will
be
remembered
that
it
was
at
the
opposite
point
in
the
direction
of
the
genappe
road
that
the
destruction
of
the
cuirassiers
had
taken
place
the
thickness
of
the
layer
of
bodies
was
proportioned
to
the
depth
of
the
hollow
road
towards
the
middle
at
the
point
where
it
became
level
where
delort
s
division
had
passed
the
layer
of
corpses
was
thinner
the
nocturnal
prowler
whom
we
have
just
shown
to
the
reader
was
going
in
that
direction
he
was
searching
that
vast
tomb
he
gazed
about
he
passed
the
dead
in
some
sort
of
hideous
review
he
walked
with
his
feet
in
the
blood
all
at
once
he
paused
a
few
paces
in
front
of
him
in
the
hollow
road
at
the
point
where
the
pile
of
dead
came
to
an
end
an
open
hand
illumined
by
the
moon
projected
from
beneath
that
heap
of
men
that
hand
had
on
its
finger
something
sparkling
which
was
a
ring
of
gold
the
man
bent
over
remained
in
a
crouching
attitude
for
a
moment
and
when
he
rose
there
was
no
longer
a
ring
on
the
hand
he
did
not
precisely
rise
he
remained
in
a
stooping
and
frightened
attitude
with
his
back
turned
to
the
heap
of
dead
scanning
the
horizon
on
his
knees
with
the
whole
upper
portion
of
his
body
supported
on
his
two
forefingers
which
rested
on
the
earth
and
his
head
peering
above
the
edge
of
the
hollow
road
the
jackal
s
four
paws
suit
some
actions
then
coming
to
a
decision
he
rose
to
his
feet
at
that
moment
he
gave
a
terrible
start
he
felt
some
one
clutch
him
from
behind
he
wheeled
round
it
was
the
open
hand
which
had
closed
and
had
seized
the
skirt
of
his
coat
an
honest
man
would
have
been
terrified
this
man
burst
into
a
laugh
come
said
he
it
s
only
a
dead
body
i
prefer
a
spook
to
a
gendarme
but
the
hand
weakened
and
released
him
effort
is
quickly
exhausted
in
the
grave
well
now
said
the
prowler
is
that
dead
fellow
alive
let
s
see
he
bent
down
again
fumbled
among
the
heap
pushed
aside
everything
that
was
in
his
way
seized
the
hand
grasped
the
arm
freed
the
head
pulled
out
the
body
and
a
few
moments
later
he
was
dragging
the
lifeless
or
at
least
the
unconscious
man
through
the
shadows
of
hollow
road
he
was
a
cuirassier
an
officer
and
even
an
officer
of
considerable
rank
a
large
gold
epaulette
peeped
from
beneath
the
cuirass
this
officer
no
longer
possessed
a
helmet
a
furious
sword
cut
had
scarred
his
face
where
nothing
was
discernible
but
blood
however
he
did
not
appear
to
have
any
broken
limbs
and
by
some
happy
chance
if
that
word
is
permissible
here
the
dead
had
been
vaulted
above
him
in
such
a
manner
as
to
preserve
him
from
being
crushed
his
eyes
were
still
closed
on
his
cuirass
he
wore
the
silver
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
the
prowler
tore
off
this
cross
which
disappeared
into
one
of
the
gulfs
which
he
had
beneath
his
great
coat
then
he
felt
of
the
officer
s
fob
discovered
a
watch
there
and
took
possession
of
it
next
he
searched
his
waistcoat
found
a
purse
and
pocketed
it
when
he
had
arrived
at
this
stage
of
succor
which
he
was
administering
to
this
dying
man
the
officer
opened
his
eyes
thanks
he
said
feebly
the
abruptness
of
the
movements
of
the
man
who
was
manipulating
him
the
freshness
of
the
night
the
air
which
he
could
inhale
freely
had
roused
him
from
his
lethargy
the
prowler
made
no
reply
he
raised
his
head
a
sound
of
footsteps
was
audible
in
the
plain
some
patrol
was
probably
approaching
the
officer
murmured
for
the
death
agony
was
still
in
his
voice
who
won
the
battle
the
english
answered
the
prowler
the
officer
went
on
look
in
my
pockets
you
will
find
a
watch
and
a
purse
take
them
it
was
already
done
the
prowler
executed
the
required
feint
and
said
there
is
nothing
there
i
have
been
robbed
said
the
officer
i
am
sorry
for
that
you
should
have
had
them
the
steps
of
the
patrol
became
more
and
more
distinct
some
one
is
coming
said
the
prowler
with
the
movement
of
a
man
who
is
taking
his
departure
the
officer
raised
his
arm
feebly
and
detained
him
you
have
saved
my
life
who
are
you
the
prowler
answered
rapidly
and
in
a
low
voice
like
yourself
i
belonged
to
the
french
army
i
must
leave
you
if
they
were
to
catch
me
they
would
shoot
me

saved
your
life

of
the
scrape

jean
valjean
had
been
recaptured
the
reader
will
be
grateful
to
us
if
we
pass
rapidly
over
the
sad
details
we
will
confine
ourselves
to
transcribing
two
paragraphs
published
by
the
journals
of
that
day
a
few
months
after
the
surprising
events
which
had
taken
place
at
m
sur
m
these
articles
are
rather
summary
it
must
be
remembered
that
at
that
epoch
the
gazette
des
tribunaux
was
not
yet
in
existence
we
borrow
the
first
from
the
drapeau
blanc
it
bears
the
date
of
july
25
1823
an
arrondissement
of
the
pas
de
calais
has
just
been
the
theatre
of
an
event
quite
out
of
the
ordinary
course
a
man
who
was
a
stranger
in
the
department
and
who
bore
the
name
of
m
madeleine
had
thanks
to
the
new
methods
resuscitated
some
years
ago
an
ancient
local
industry
the
manufacture
of
jet
and
of
black
glass
trinkets
he
had
made
his
fortune
in
the
business
and
that
of
the
arrondissement
as
well
we
will
admit
he
had
been
appointed
mayor
in
recognition
of
his
services
the
police
discovered
that
m
madeleine
was
no
other
than
an
ex
convict
who
had
broken
his
ban
condemned
in
1796
for
theft
and
named
jean
valjean
jean
valjean
has
been
recommitted
to
prison
it
appears
that
previous
to
his
arrest
he
had
succeeded
in
withdrawing
from
the
hands
of
m
laffitte
a
sum
of
over
half
a
million
which
he
had
lodged
there
and
which
he
had
moreover
and
by
perfectly
legitimate
means
acquired
in
his
business
no
one
has
been
able
to
discover
where
jean
valjean
has
concealed
this
money
since
his
return
to
prison
at
toulon
the
second
article
which
enters
a
little
more
into
detail
is
an
extract
from
the
journal
de
paris
of
the
same
date
a
former
convict
who
had
been
liberated
named
jean
valjean
has
just
appeared
before
the
court
of
assizes
of
the
var
under
circumstances
calculated
to
attract
attention
this
wretch
had
succeeded
in
escaping
the
vigilance
of
the
police
he
had
changed
his
name
and
had
succeeded
in
getting
himself
appointed
mayor
of
one
of
our
small
northern
towns
in
this
town
he
had
established
a
considerable
commerce
he
has
at
last
been
unmasked
and
arrested
thanks
to
the
indefatigable
zeal
of
the
public
prosecutor
he
had
for
his
concubine
a
woman
of
the
town
who
died
of
a
shock
at
the
moment
of
his
arrest
this
scoundrel
who
is
endowed
with
herculean
strength
found
means
to
escape
but
three
or
four
days
after
his
flight
the
police
laid
their
hands
on
him
once
more
in
paris
itself
at
the
very
moment
when
he
was
entering
one
of
those
little
vehicles
which
run
between
the
capital
and
the
village
of
montfermeil
seine
et
oise
he
is
said
to
have
profited
by
this
interval
of
three
or
four
days
of
liberty
to
withdraw
a
considerable
sum
deposited
by
him
with
one
of
our
leading
bankers
this
sum
has
been
estimated
at
six
or
seven
hundred
thousand
francs
if
the
indictment
is
to
be
trusted
he
has
hidden
it
in
some
place
known
to
himself
alone
and
it
has
not
been
possible
to
lay
hands
on
it
however
that
may
be
the
said
jean
valjean
has
just
been
brought
before
the
assizes
of
the
department
of
the
var
as
accused
of
highway
robbery
accompanied
with
violence
about
eight
years
ago
on
the
person
of
one
of
those
honest
children
who
as
the
patriarch
of
ferney
has
said
in
immortal
verse
arrive
from
savoy
every
year
and
who
with
gentle
hands
do
clear
those
long
canals
choked
up
with
soot
this
bandit
refused
to
defend
himself
it
was
proved
by
the
skilful
and
eloquent
representative
of
the
public
prosecutor
that
the

attention
to
the
fact
in

rostrum
in
the
month
of
february
1827
chapter
ii
in
which
the
reader
will
peruse
two
verses
which
are
of
the
devil
s
composition
possibly
before
proceeding
further
it
will
be
to
the
purpose
to
narrate
in
some
detail
a
singular
occurrence
which
took
place
at
about
the
same
epoch
in
montfermeil
and
which
is
not
lacking
in
coincidence
with
certain
conjectures
of
the
indictment
there
exists
in
the
region
of
montfermeil
a
very
ancient
superstition
which
is
all
the
more
curious
and
all
the
more
precious
because
a
popular
superstition
in
the
vicinity
of
paris
is
like
an
aloe
in
siberia
we
are
among
those
who
respect
everything
which
is
in
the
nature
of
a
rare
plant
here
then
is
the
superstition
of
montfermeil
it
is
thought
that
the
devil
from
time
immemorial
has
selected
the
forest
as
a
hiding
place
for
his
treasures
goodwives
affirm
that
it
is
no
rarity
to
encounter
at
nightfall
in
secluded
nooks
of
the
forest
a
black
man
with
the
air
of
a
carter
or
a
wood
chopper
wearing
wooden
shoes
clad
in
trousers
and
a
blouse
of
linen
and
recognizable
by
the
fact
that
instead
of
a
cap
or
hat
he
has
two
immense
horns
on
his
head
this
ought
in
fact
to
render
him
recognizable
this
man
is
habitually
engaged
in
digging
a
hole
there
are
three
ways
of
profiting
by
such
an
encounter
the
first
is
to
approach
the
man
and
speak
to
him
then
it
is
seen
that
the
man
is
simply
a
peasant
that
he
appears
black
because
it
is
nightfall
that
he
is
not
digging
any
hole
whatever
but
is
cutting
grass
for
his
cows
and
that
what
had
been
taken
for
horns
is
nothing
but
a
dung
fork
which
he
is
carrying
on
his
back
and
whose
teeth
thanks
to
the
perspective
of
evening
seemed
to
spring
from
his
head
the
man
returns
home
and
dies
within
the
week
the
second
way
is
to
watch
him
to
wait
until
he
has
dug
his
hole
until
he
has
filled
it
and
has
gone
away
then
to
run
with
great
speed
to
the
trench
to
open
it
once
more
and
to
seize
the
treasure
which
the
black
man
has
necessarily
placed
there
in
this
case
one
dies
within
the
month
finally
the
last
method
is
not
to
speak
to
the
black
man
not
to
look
at
him
and
to
flee
at
the
best
speed
of
one
s
legs
one
then
dies
within
the
year
as
all
three
methods
are
attended
with
their
special
inconveniences
the
second
which
at
all
events
presents
some
advantages
among
others
that
of
possessing
a
treasure
if
only
for
a
month
is
the
one
most
generally
adopted
so
bold
men
who
are
tempted
by
every
chance
have
quite
frequently
as
we
are
assured
opened
the
holes
excavated
by
the
black
man
and
tried
to
rob
the
devil
the
success
of
the
operation
appears
to
be
but
moderate
at
least
if
the
tradition
is
to
be
believed
and
in
particular
the
two
enigmatical
lines
in
barbarous
latin
which
an
evil
norman
monk
a
bit
of
a
sorcerer
named
tryphon
has
left
on
this
subject
this
tryphon
is
buried
at
the
abbey
of
saint
georges
de
bocherville
near
rouen
and
toads
spawn
on
his
grave
accordingly
enormous
efforts
are
made
such
trenches
are
ordinarily
extremely
deep
a
man
sweats
digs
toils
all
night
for
it
must
be
done
at
night
he
wets
his
shirt
burns
out
his
candle
breaks
his
mattock
and
when
he
arrives
at
the
bottom
of
the
hole
when
he
lays
his
hand
on
the
treasure
what
does
he
find
what
is
the
devil
s
treasure
a
sou
sometimes
a
crown
piece
a
stone
a
skeleton
a
bleeding
body
sometimes
a
spectre
folded
in
four
like
a
sheet
of
paper
in
a
portfolio
sometimes
nothing
this
is
what
tryphon
s
verses
seem
to
announce
to
the
indiscreet
and
curious
fodit
et
in
fossa
thesauros
condit
opaca
as
nummas
lapides
cadaver
simulacra
nihilque
it
seems
that
in
our
day
there
is
sometimes
found
a
powder
horn
with
bullets
sometimes
an
old
pack
of
cards
greasy
and
worn
which
has
evidently
served
the
devil
tryphon
does
not
record
these
two
finds
since
tryphon
lived
in
the
twelfth
century
and
since
the
devil
does
not
appear
to
have
had
the
wit
to
invent
powder
before
roger
bacon
s
time
and
cards
before
the
time
of
charles
vi
moreover
if
one
plays
at
cards
one
is
sure
to
lose
all
that
one
possesses
and
as
for
the
powder
in
the
horn
it
possesses
the
property
of
making
your
gun
burst
in
your
face
now
a
very
short
time
after
the
epoch
when
it
seemed
to
the
prosecuting
attorney
that
the
liberated
convict
jean
valjean
during
his
flight
of
several
days
had
been
prowling
around
montfermeil
it
was
remarked
in
that
village
that
a
certain
old
road
laborer
named
boulatruelle
had
peculiar
ways
in
the
forest
people
thereabouts
thought
they
knew
that
this
boulatruelle
had
been
in
the
galleys
he
was
subjected
to
certain
police
supervision
and
as
he
could
find
work
nowhere
the
administration
employed
him
at
reduced
rates
as
a
road
mender
on
the
cross
road
from
gagny
to
lagny
this
boulatruelle
was
a
man
who
was
viewed
with
disfavor
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
district
as
too
respectful
too
humble
too
prompt
in
removing
his
cap
to
every
one
and
trembling
and
smiling
in
the
presence
of
the
gendarmes
probably
affiliated
to
robber
bands
they
said
suspected
of
lying
in
ambush
at
verge
of
copses
at
nightfall
the
only
thing
in
his
favor
was
that
he
was
a
drunkard
this
is
what
people
thought
they
had
noticed
of
late
boulatruelle
had
taken
to
quitting
his
task
of
stone
breaking
and
care
of
the
road
at
a
very
early
hour
and
to
betaking
himself
to
the
forest
with
his
pickaxe
he
was
encountered
towards
evening
in
the
most
deserted
clearings
in
the
wildest
thickets
and
he
had
the
appearance
of
being
in
search
of
something
and
sometimes
he
was
digging
holes
the
goodwives
who
passed
took
him
at
first
for
beelzebub
then
they
recognized
boulatruelle
and
were
not
in
the
least
reassured
thereby
these
encounters
seemed
to
cause
boulatruelle
a
lively
displeasure
it
was
evident
that
he
sought
to
hide
and
that
there
was
some
mystery
in
what
he
was
doing
it
was
said
in
the
village
it
is
clear
that
the
devil
has
appeared
boulatruelle
has
seen
him
and
is
on
the
search
in
sooth
he
is
cunning
enough
to
pocket
lucifer
s
hoard
the
voltairians
added
will
boulatruelle
catch
the
devil
or
will
the
devil
catch
boulatruelle
the
old
women
made
a
great
many
signs
of
the
cross
in
the
meantime
boulatruelle
s
manoeuvres
in
the
forest
ceased
and
he
resumed
his
regular
occupation
of
roadmending
and
people
gossiped
of
something
else
some
persons
however
were
still
curious
surmising
that
in
all
this
there
was
probably
no
fabulous
treasure
of
the
legends
but
some
fine
windfall
of
a
more
serious
and
palpable
sort
than
the
devil
s
bank
bills
and
that
the
road
mender
had
half
discovered
the
secret
the
most
puzzled
were
the
school
master
and
thenardier
the
proprietor
of
the
tavern
who
was
everybody
s
friend
and
had
not
disdained
to
ally
himself
with
boulatruelle
he
has
been
in
the
galleys
said
thenardier
eh
good
god
no
one
knows
who
has
been
there
or
will
be
there
one
evening
the
schoolmaster
affirmed
that
in
former
times
the
law
would
have
instituted
an
inquiry
as
to
what
boulatruelle
did
in
the
forest
and
that
the
latter
would
have
been
forced
to
speak
and
that
he
would
have
been
put
to
the
torture
in
case
of
need
and
that
boulatruelle
would
not
have
resisted
the
water
test
for
example
let
us
put
him
to
the
wine
test
said
thenardier
they
made
an
effort
and
got
the
old
road
mender
to
drinking
boulatruelle
drank
an
enormous
amount
but
said
very
little
he
combined
with
admirable
art
and
in
masterly
proportions
the
thirst
of
a
gormandizer
with
the
discretion
of
a
judge
nevertheless
by
dint
of
returning
to
the
charge
and
of
comparing
and
putting
together
the
few
obscure
words
which
he
did
allow
to
escape
him
this
is
what
thenardier
and
the
schoolmaster
imagined
that
they
had
made
out
one
morning
when
boulatruelle
was
on
his
way
to
his
work
at
daybreak
he
had
been
surprised
to
see
at
a
nook
of
the
forest
in
the
underbrush
a
shovel
and
a
pickaxe
concealed
as
one
might
say
however
he
might
have
supposed
that
they
were
probably
the
shovel
and
pick
of
father
six
fours
the
water
carrier
and
would
have
thought
no
more
about
it
but
on
the
evening
of
that
day
he
saw
without
being
seen
himself
as
he
was
hidden
by
a
large
tree
a
person
who
did
not
belong
in
those
parts
and
whom
he
boulatruelle
knew
well
directing
his
steps
towards
the
densest
part
of
the
wood
translation
by
thenardier
a
comrade
of
the
galleys
boulatruelle
obstinately
refused
to
reveal
his
name
this
person
carried
a
package
something
square
like
a
large
box
or
a
small
trunk
surprise
on
the
part
of
boulatruelle
however
it
was
only
after
the
expiration
of
seven
or
eight
minutes
that
the
idea
of
following
that
person
had
occurred
to
him
but
it
was
too
late
the
person
was
already
in
the
thicket
night
had
descended
and
boulatruelle
had
not
been
able
to
catch
up
with
him
then
he
had
adopted
the
course
of
watching
for
him
at
the
edge
of
the
woods
it
was
moonlight
two
or
three
hours
later
boulatruelle
had
seen
this
person
emerge
from
the
brushwood
carrying
no
longer
the
coffer
but
a
shovel
and
pick
boulatruelle
had
allowed
the
person
to
pass
and
had
not
dreamed
of
accosting
him
because
he
said
to
himself
that
the
other
man
was
three
times
as
strong
as
he
was
and
armed
with
a
pickaxe
and
that
he
would
probably
knock
him
over
the
head
on
recognizing
him
and
on
perceiving
that
he
was
recognized
touching
effusion
of
two
old
comrades
on
meeting
again
but
the
shovel
and
pick
had
served
as
a
ray
of
light
to
boulatruelle
he
had
hastened
to
the
thicket
in
the
morning
and
had
found
neither
shovel
nor
pick
from
this
he
had
drawn
the
inference
that
this
person
once
in
the
forest
had
dug
a
hole
with
his
pick
buried
the
coffer
and
reclosed
the
hole
with
his
shovel
now
the
coffer
was
too
small
to
contain
a
body
therefore
it
contained
money
hence
his
researches
boulatruelle
had
explored
sounded
searched
the
entire
forest
and
the
thicket
and
had
dug
wherever
the
earth
appeared
to
him
to
have
been
recently
turned
up
in
vain
he
had
ferreted
out
nothing
no
one
in
montfermeil
thought
any
more
about
it
there
were
only
a
few
brave
gossips
who
said
you
may
be
certain
that
the
mender
on
the
gagny
road
did
not
take
all
that
trouble
for
nothing
he
was
sure
that
the
devil
had
come

little

shame
for
some

for
no

such
was
this
war
made
by
the
princes
descended
from
louis
xiv
and
conducted
by
generals
who
had
been
under
napoleon
its
sad
fate
was
to
recall
neither
the
grand
war
nor
grand
politics
some
feats
of
arms
were
serious
the
taking
of
the
trocadero
among
others
was
a
fine
military
action
but
after
all
we
repeat
the
trumpets
of
this
war
give
back
a
cracked
sound
the
whole
effect
was
suspicious
history
approves
of
france
for
making
a
difficulty
about
accepting
this
false
triumph
it
seemed
evident
that
certain
spanish
officers
charged
with
resistance
yielded
too
easily
the
idea
of
corruption
was
connected
with
the
victory
it
appears
as
though
generals
and
not
battles
had
been
won
and
the
conquering
soldier
returned
humiliated
a
debasing
war
in
short
in
which
the
bank
of
france
could
be
read
in
the
folds
of
the
flag
soldiers
of
the
war
of
1808
on
whom
saragossa
had
fallen
in
formidable
ruin
frowned
in
1823
at
the
easy
surrender
of
citadels
and
began
to
regret
palafox
it
is
the
nature
of
france
to
prefer
to
have
rostopchine
rather
than
ballesteros
in
front
of
her
from
a
still
more
serious
point
of
view
and
one
which
it
is
also
proper
to
insist
upon
here
this
war
which
wounded
the
military
spirit
of
france
enraged
the
democratic
spirit
it
was
an
enterprise
of
inthralment
in
that
campaign
the
object
of
the
french
soldier
the
son
of
democracy
was
the
conquest
of
a
yoke
for
others
a
hideous
contradiction
france
is
made
to
arouse
the
soul
of
nations
not
to
stifle
it
all
the
revolutions
of
europe
since
1792
are
the
french
revolution
liberty
darts
rays
from
france
that
is
a
solar
fact
blind
is
he
who
will
not
see
it
was
bonaparte
who
said
it
the
war
of
1823
an
outrage
on
the
generous
spanish
nation
was
then
at
the
same
time
an
outrage
on
the
french
revolution
it
was
france
who
committed
this
monstrous
violence
by
foul
means
for
with
the
exception
of
wars
of
liberation
everything
that
armies
do
is
by
foul
means
the
words
passive
obedience
indicate
this
an
army
is
a
strange
masterpiece
of
combination
where
force
results
from
an
enormous
sum
of
impotence
thus
is
war
made
by
humanity
against
humanity
despite
humanity
explained
as
for
the
bourbons
the
war
of
1823
was
fatal
to
them
they
took
it
for
a
success
they
did
not
perceive
the
danger
that
lies
in
having
an
idea
slain
to
order
they
went
astray
in
their
innocence
to
such
a
degree
that
they
introduced
the
immense
enfeeblement
of
a
crime
into
their
establishment
as
an
element
of
strength
the
spirit
of
the
ambush
entered
into
their
politics
1830
had
its
germ
in
1823
the
spanish
campaign
became
in
their
counsels
an
argument
for
force
and
for
adventures
by
right
divine
france
having
re
established
elrey
netto
in
spain
might
well
have
re
established
the
absolute
king
at
home
they
fell
into
the
alarming
error
of
taking
the
obedience
of
the
soldier
for
the
consent
of
the
nation
such
confidence
is
the
ruin
of
thrones
it
is
not
permitted
to
fall
asleep
either
in
the
shadow
of
a
machineel
tree
nor
in
the
shadow
of
an
army
let
us
return
to
the
ship
orion
during
the
operations
of
the
army
commanded
by
the
prince
generalissimo
a
squadron
had
been
cruising
in
the
mediterranean
we
have
just
stated
that
the
orion
belonged
to
this
fleet
and
that
accidents
of
the
sea
had
brought
it
into
port
at
toulon
the
presence
of
a
vessel
of
war
in
a
port
has
something
about
it
which
attracts
and
engages
a
crowd
it
is
because
it
is
great
and
the
crowd
loves
what
is
great
a
ship
of
the
line
is
one
of
the
most
magnificent
combinations
of
the
genius
of
man
with
the
powers
of
nature
a
ship
of
the
line
is
composed
at
the
same
time
of
the
heaviest
and
the
lightest
of
possible
matter
for
it
deals
at
one
and
the
same
time
with
three
forms
of
substance
solid
liquid
and
fluid
and
it
must
do
battle
with
all
three
it
has
eleven
claws
of
iron
with
which
to
seize
the
granite
on
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
more
wings
and
more
antennae
than
winged
insects
to
catch
the
wind
in
the
clouds
its
breath
pours
out
through
its
hundred
and
twenty
cannons
as
through
enormous
trumpets
and
replies
proudly
to
the
thunder
the
ocean
seeks
to
lead
it
astray
in
the
alarming
sameness
of
its
billows
but
the
vessel
has
its
soul
its
compass
which
counsels
it
and
always
shows
it
the
north
in
the
blackest
nights
its
lanterns
supply
the
place
of
the
stars
thus
against
the
wind
it
has
its
cordage
and
its
canvas
against
the
water
wood
against
the
rocks
its
iron
brass
and
lead
against
the
shadows
its
light
against
immensity
a
needle
if
one
wishes
to
form
an
idea
of
all
those
gigantic
proportions
which
taken
as
a
whole
constitute
the
ship
of
the
line
one
has
only
to
enter
one
of
the
six
story
covered
construction
stocks
in
the
ports
of
brest
or
toulon
the
vessels
in
process
of
construction
are
under
a
bell
glass
there
as
it
were
this
colossal
beam
is
a
yard
that
great
column
of
wood
which
stretches
out
on
the
earth
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
is
the
main
mast
taking
it
from
its
root
in
the
stocks
to
its
tip
in
the
clouds
it
is
sixty
fathoms
long
and
its
diameter
at
its
base
is
three
feet
the
english
main
mast
rises
to
a
height
of
two
hundred
and
seventeen
feet
above
the
water
line
the
navy
of
our
fathers
employed
cables
ours
employs
chains
the
simple
pile
of
chains
on
a
ship
of
a
hundred
guns
is
four
feet
high
twenty
feet
in
breadth
and
eight
feet
in
depth
and
how
much
wood
is
required
to
make
this
ship
three
thousand
cubic
metres
it
is
a
floating
forest
and
moreover
let
this
be
borne
in
mind
it
is
only
a
question
here
of
the
military
vessel
of
forty
years
ago
of
the
simple
sailing
vessel
steam
then
in
its
infancy
has
since
added
new
miracles
to
that
prodigy
which
is
called
a
war
vessel
at
the
present
time
for
example
the
mixed
vessel
with
a
screw
is
a
surprising
machine
propelled
by
three
thousand
square
metres
of
canvas
and
by
an
engine
of
two
thousand
five
hundred
horse
power
not
to
mention
these
new
marvels
the
ancient
vessel
of
christopher
columbus
and
of
de
ruyter
is
one
of
the
masterpieces
of
man
it
is
as
inexhaustible
in
force
as
is
the
infinite
in
gales
it
stores
up
the
wind
in
its
sails
it
is
precise
in
the
immense
vagueness
of
the
billows
it
floats
and
it
reigns
there
comes
an
hour
nevertheless
when
the
gale
breaks
that
sixty
foot
yard
like
a
straw
when
the
wind
bends
that
mast
four
hundred
feet
tall
when
that
anchor
which
weighs
tens
of
thousands
is
twisted
in
the
jaws
of
the
waves
like
a
fisherman
s
hook
in
the
jaws
of
a
pike
when
those
monstrous
cannons
utter
plaintive
and
futile
roars
which
the
hurricane
bears
forth
into
the
void
and
into
night
when
all
that
power
and
all
that
majesty
are
engulfed
in
a
power
and
majesty
which
are
superior
every
time
that
immense
force
is
displayed
to
culminate
in
an
immense
feebleness
it
affords
men
food
for
thought
hence
in
the
ports
curious
people
abound
around
these
marvellous
machines
of
war
and
of
navigation
without
being
able
to
explain
perfectly
to
themselves
why
every
day
accordingly
from
morning
until
night
the
quays
sluices
and
the
jetties
of
the
port
of
toulon
were
covered
with
a
multitude
of
idlers
and
loungers
as
they
say
in
paris
whose
business
consisted
in
staring
at
the
orion
the
orion
was
a
ship
that
had
been
ailing
for
a
long
time
in
the
course
of
its
previous
cruises
thick
layers
of
barnacles
had
collected
on
its
keel
to
such
a
degree
as
to
deprive
it
of
half
its
speed
it
had
gone
into
the
dry
dock
the
year
before
this
in
order
to
have
the
barnacles
scraped
off
then
it
had
put
to
sea
again
but
this
cleaning
had
affected
the
bolts
of
the
keel
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
balearic
isles
the
sides
had
been
strained
and
had
opened
and
as
the
plating
in
those
days
was
not
of
sheet
iron
the
vessel
had
sprung
a
leak
a
violent
equinoctial
gale
had
come
up
which
had
first
staved
in
a
grating
and
a
porthole
on
the
larboard
side
and
damaged
the
foretop
gallant
shrouds
in
consequence
of
these
injuries
the
orion
had
run
back
to
toulon
it
anchored
near
the
arsenal
it
was
fully
equipped
and
repairs
were
begun
the
hull
had
received
no
damage
on
the
starboard
but
some
of
the
planks
had
been
unnailed
here
and
there
according
to
custom
to
permit
of
air
entering
the
hold
one
morning
the
crowd
which
was
gazing
at
it
witnessed
an
accident
illustration
the
ship
orion
an
accident
2b2
1
the
ship
orion
the
crew
was
busy
bending
the
sails
the
topman
who
had
to
take
the
upper
corner
of
the
main
top
sail
on
the
starboard
lost
his
balance
he
was
seen
to
waver
the
multitude
thronging
the
arsenal
quay
uttered
a
cry
the
man
s
head
overbalanced
his
body
the
man
fell
around
the
yard
with
his
hands
outstretched
towards
the
abyss
on
his
way
he
seized
the
footrope
first
with
one
hand
then
with
the
other
and
remained
hanging
from
it
the
sea
lay
below
him
at
a
dizzy
depth
the
shock
of
his
fall
had
imparted
to
the
foot
rope
a
violent
swinging
motion
the
man
swayed
back
and
forth
at
the
end
of
that
rope
like
a
stone
in
a
sling
it
was
incurring
a
frightful
risk
to
go
to
his
assistance
not
one
of
the
sailors
all
fishermen
of
the
coast
recently
levied
for
the
service
dared
to
attempt
it
in
the
meantime
the
unfortunate
topman
was
losing
his
strength
his
anguish
could
not
be
discerned
on
his
face
but
his
exhaustion
was
visible
in
every
limb
his
arms
were
contracted
in
horrible
twitchings
every
effort
which
he
made
to
re
ascend
served
but
to
augment
the
oscillations
of
the
foot
rope
he
did
not
shout
for
fear
of
exhausting
his
strength
all
were
awaiting
the
minute
when
he
should
release
his
hold
on
the
rope
and
from
instant
to
instant
heads
were
turned
aside
that
his
fall
might
not
be
seen
there
are
moments
when
a
bit
of
rope
a
pole
the
branch
of
a
tree
is
life
itself
and
it
is
a
terrible
thing
to
see
a
living
being
detach
himself
from
it
and
fall
like
a
ripe
fruit
all
at
once
a
man
was
seen
climbing
into
the
rigging
with
the
agility
of
a
tiger
cat
this
man
was
dressed
in
red
he
was
a
convict
he
wore
a
green
cap
he
was
a
life
convict
on
arriving
on
a
level
with
the
top
a
gust
of
wind
carried
away
his
cap
and
allowed
a
perfectly
white
head
to
be
seen
he
was
not
a
young
man
a
convict
employed
on
board
with
a
detachment
from
the
galleys
had
in
fact
at
the
very
first
instant
hastened
to
the
officer
of
the
watch
and
in
the
midst
of
the
consternation
and
the
hesitation
of
the
crew
while
all
the
sailors
were
trembling
and
drawing
back
he
had
asked
the
officer
s
permission
to
risk
his
life
to
save
the
topman
at
an
affirmative
sign
from
the
officer
he
had
broken
the
chain
riveted
to
his
ankle
with
one
blow
of
a
hammer
then
he
had
caught
up
a
rope
and
had
dashed
into
the
rigging
no
one
noticed
at
the
instant
with
what
ease
that
chain
had
been
broken
it
was
only
later
on
that
the
incident
was
recalled
in
a
twinkling
he
was
on
the
yard
he
paused
for
a
few
seconds
and
appeared
to
be
measuring
it
with
his
eye
these
seconds
during
which
the
breeze
swayed
the
topman
at
the
extremity
of
a
thread
seemed
centuries
to
those
who
were
looking
on
at
last
the
convict
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
advanced
a
step
the
crowd
drew
a
long
breath
he
was
seen
to
run
out
along
the
yard
on
arriving
at
the
point
he
fastened
the
rope
which
he
had
brought
to
it
and
allowed
the
other
end
to
hang
down
then
he
began
to
descend
the
rope
hand
over
hand
and
then
and
the
anguish
was
indescribable
instead
of
one
man
suspended
over
the
gulf
there
were
two
one
would
have
said
it
was
a
spider
coming
to
seize
a
fly
only
here
the
spider
brought
life
not
death
ten
thousand
glances
were
fastened
on
this
group
not
a
cry
not
a
word
the
same
tremor
contracted
every
brow
all
mouths
held
their
breath
as
though
they
feared
to
add
the
slightest
puff
to
the
wind
which
was
swaying
the
two
unfortunate
men
in
the
meantime
the
convict
had
succeeded
in
lowering
himself
to
a
position
near
the
sailor
it
was
high
time
one
minute
more
and
the
exhausted
and
despairing
man
would
have
allowed
himself
to
fall
into
the
abyss
the
convict
had
moored
him
securely
with
the
cord
to
which
he
clung
with
one
hand
while
he
was
working
with
the
other
at
last
he
was
seen
to
climb
back
on
the
yard
and
to
drag
the
sailor
up
after
him
he
held
him
there
a
moment
to
allow
him
to
recover
his
strength
then
he
grasped
him
in
his
arms
and
carried
him
walking
on
the
yard
himself
to
the
cap
and
from
there
to
the
main
top
where
he
left
him
in
the
hands
of
his
comrades
at
that
moment
the
crowd
broke
into
applause
old
convict
sergeants
among
them
wept
and
women
embraced
each
other
on
the
quay
and
all
voices
were
heard
to
cry
with
a
sort
of
tender
rage
pardon
for
that
man
he
in
the
meantime
had
immediately
begun
to
make
his
descent
to
rejoin
his
detachment
in
order
to
reach
them
the
more
speedily
he
dropped
into
the
rigging
and
ran
along
one
of
the
lower
yards
all
eyes
were
following
him
at
a
certain
moment
fear
assailed
them
whether
it
was
that
he
was
fatigued
or
that
his
head
turned
they
thought
they
saw
him
hesitate
and
stagger
all
at
once
the
crowd
uttered
a
loud
shout
the
convict
had
fallen
into
the
sea
the
fall
was
perilous
the
frigate
algesiras
was
anchored
alongside
the
orion
and
the
poor
convict
had
fallen
between
the
two
vessels
it
was
to
be
feared
that
he
would
slip
under
one
or
the
other
of
them
four
men
flung
themselves
hastily
into
a
boat
the
crowd
cheered
them
on
anxiety
again
took
possession
of
all
souls
the
man
had
not
risen
to
the
surface
he
had
disappeared
in
the
sea
without
leaving
a
ripple
as
though
he
had
fallen
into
a
cask
of
oil
they
sounded
they
dived
in
vain
the
search
was
continued
until
the
evening
they
did
not
even
find
the
body
on
the
following
day
the
toulon

printed

fell
into

the
water
question
at
montfermeil
montfermeil
is
situated
between
livry
and
chelles
on
the
southern
edge
of
that
lofty
table
land
which
separates
the
ourcq
from
the
marne
at
the
present
day
it
is
a
tolerably
large
town
ornamented
all
the
year
through
with
plaster
villas
and
on
sundays
with
beaming
bourgeois
in
1823
there
were
at
montfermeil
neither
so
many
white
houses
nor
so
many
well
satisfied
citizens
it
was
only
a
village
in
the
forest
some
pleasure
houses
of
the
last
century
were
to
be
met
with
there
to
be
sure
which
were
recognizable
by
their
grand
air
their
balconies
in
twisted
iron
and
their
long
windows
whose
tiny
panes
cast
all
sorts
of
varying
shades
of
green
on
the
white
of
the
closed
shutters
but
montfermeil
was
none
the
less
a
village
retired
cloth
merchants
and
rusticating
attorneys
had
not
discovered
it
as
yet
it
was
a
peaceful
and
charming
place
which
was
not
on
the
road
to
anywhere
there
people
lived
and
cheaply
that
peasant
rustic
life
which
is
so
bounteous
and
so
easy
only
water
was
rare
there
on
account
of
the
elevation
of
the
plateau
it
was
necessary
to
fetch
it
from
a
considerable
distance
the
end
of
the
village
towards
gagny
drew
its
water
from
the
magnificent
ponds
which
exist
in
the
woods
there
the
other
end
which
surrounds
the
church
and
which
lies
in
the
direction
of
chelles
found
drinking
water
only
at
a
little
spring
half
way
down
the
slope
near
the
road
to
chelles
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
from
montfermeil
thus
each
household
found
it
hard
work
to
keep
supplied
with
water
the
large
houses
the
aristocracy
of
which
the
thenardier
tavern
formed
a
part
paid
half
a
farthing
a
bucketful
to
a
man
who
made
a
business
of
it
and
who
earned
about
eight
sous
a
day
in
his
enterprise
of
supplying
montfermeil
with
water
but
this
good
man
only
worked
until
seven
o
clock
in
the
evening
in
summer
and
five
in
winter
and
night
once
come
and
the
shutters
on
the
ground
floor
once
closed
he
who
had
no
water
to
drink
went
to
fetch
it
for
himself
or
did
without
it
this
constituted
the
terror
of
the
poor
creature
whom
the
reader
has
probably
not
forgotten
little
cosette
it
will
be
remembered
that
cosette
was
useful
to
the
thenardiers
in
two
ways
they
made
the
mother
pay
them
and
they
made
the
child
serve
them
so
when
the
mother
ceased
to
pay
altogether
the
reason
for
which
we
have
read
in
preceding
chapters
the
thenardiers
kept
cosette
she
took
the
place
of
a
servant
in
their
house
in
this
capacity
she
it
was
who
ran
to
fetch
water
when
it
was
required
so
the
child
who
was
greatly
terrified
at
the
idea
of
going
to
the
spring
at
night
took
great
care
that
water
should
never
be
lacking
in
the
house
christmas
of
the
year
1823
was
particularly
brilliant
at
montfermeil
the
beginning
of
the
winter
had
been
mild
there
had
been
neither
snow
nor
frost
up
to
that
time
some
mountebanks
from
paris
had
obtained
permission
of
the
mayor
to
erect
their
booths
in
the
principal
street
of
the
village
and
a
band
of
itinerant
merchants
under
protection
of
the
same
tolerance
had
constructed
their
stalls
on
the
church
square
and
even
extended
them
into
boulanger
alley
where
as
the
reader
will
perhaps
remember
the
thenardiers
hostelry
was
situated
these
people
filled
the
inns
and
drinking
shops
and
communicated
to
that
tranquil
little
district
a
noisy
and
joyous
life
in
order
to
play
the
part
of
a
faithful
historian
we
ought
even
to
add
that
among
the
curiosities
displayed
in
the
square
there
was
a
menagerie
in
which
frightful
clowns
clad
in
rags
and
coming
no
one
knew
whence
exhibited
to
the
peasants
of
montfermeil
in
1823
one
of
those
horrible
brazilian
vultures
such
as
our
royal
museum
did
not
possess
until
1845
and
which
have
a
tricolored
cockade
for
an
eye
i
believe
that
naturalists
call
this
bird
caracara
polyborus
it
belongs
to
the
order
of
the
apicides
and
to
the
family
of
the
vultures
some
good
old
bonapartist
soldiers
who
had
retired
to
the
village
went
to
see
this
creature
with
great
devotion
the
mountebanks
gave
out
that
the
tricolored
cockade
was
a
unique
phenomenon
made
by
god
expressly
for
their
menagerie
on
christmas
eve
itself
a
number
of
men
carters
and
peddlers
were
seated
at
table
drinking
and
smoking
around
four
or
five
candles
in
the
public
room
of
thenardier
s
hostelry
this
room
resembled
all
drinking
shop
rooms
tables
pewter
jugs
bottles
drinkers
smokers
but
little
light
and
a
great
deal
of
noise
the
date
of
the
year
1823
was
indicated
nevertheless
by
two
objects
which
were
then
fashionable
in
the
bourgeois
class
to
wit
a
kaleidoscope
and
a
lamp
of
ribbed
tin
the
female
thenardier
was
attending
to
the
supper
which
was
roasting
in
front
of
a
clear
fire
her
husband
was
drinking
with
his
customers
and
talking
politics
besides
political
conversations
which
had
for
their
principal
subjects
the
spanish
war
and
m
le
duc
d
angouleme
strictly
local
parentheses
like
the
following
were
audible
amid
the
uproar
about
nanterre
and
suresnes
the
vines
have
flourished
greatly
when
ten
pieces
were
reckoned
on
there
have
been
twelve
they
have
yielded
a
great
deal
of
juice
under
the
press
but
the
grapes
cannot
be
ripe
in
those
parts
the
grapes
should
not
be
ripe
the
wine
turns
oily
as
soon
as
spring
comes
then
it
is
very
thin
wine
there
are
wines
poorer
even
than
these
the
grapes
must
be
gathered
while
green
etc
or
a
miller
would
call
out
are
we
responsible
for
what
is
in
the
sacks
we
find
in
them
a
quantity
of
small
seed
which
we
cannot
sift
out
and
which
we
are
obliged
to
send
through
the
mill
stones
there
are
tares
fennel
vetches
hempseed
fox
tail
and
a
host
of
other
weeds
not
to
mention
pebbles
which
abound
in
certain
wheat
especially
in
breton
wheat
i
am
not
fond
of
grinding
breton
wheat
any
more
than
long
sawyers
like
to
saw
beams
with
nails
in
them
you
can
judge
of
the
bad
dust
that
makes
in
grinding
and
then
people
complain
of
the
flour
they
are
in
the
wrong
the
flour
is
no
fault
of
ours
in
a
space
between
two
windows
a
mower
who
was
seated
at
table
with
a
landed
proprietor
who
was
fixing
on
a
price
for
some
meadow
work
to
be
performed
in
the
spring
was
saying
it
does
no
harm
to
have
the
grass
wet
it
cuts
better
dew
is
a
good
thing
sir
it
makes
no
difference
with
that
grass
your
grass
is
young
and
very
hard
to
cut
still
it
s
terribly
tender
it
yields
before
the
iron
etc
cosette
was
in
her
usual
place
seated
on
the
cross
bar
of
the
kitchen
table
near
the
chimney
she
was
in
rags
her
bare
feet
were
thrust
into
wooden
shoes
and
by
the
firelight
she
was
engaged
in
knitting
woollen
stockings
destined
for
the
young
thenardiers
a
very
young
kitten
was
playing
about
among
the
chairs
laughter
and
chatter
were
audible
in
the
adjoining
room
from
two
fresh
children
s
voices
it
was
eponine
and
azelma
in
the
chimney
corner
a
cat
o
nine
tails
was
hanging
on
a
nail
at
intervals
the
cry
of
a
very
young
child
which
was
somewhere
in
the
house
rang
through
the
noise
of
the
dram
shop
it
was
a
little
boy
who
had
been
born
to
the
thenardiers
during
one
of
the
preceding
winters
she
did
not
know
why
she
said
the
result
of
the
cold
and
who
was
a
little
more
than
three
years
old
the
mother
had
nursed
him
but
she
did
not
love
him
when
the
persistent
clamor
of
the
brat
became
too
annoying
your
son
is
squalling
thenardier
would
say
do
go
and
see
what
he
wants
bah
the
mother
would
reply
he
bothers
me
and
the
neglected
child
continued
to
shriek
in
the
dark
chapter
ii
two
complete
portraits
so
far
in
this
book
the
thenardiers
have
been
viewed
only
in
profile
the
moment
has
arrived
for
making
the
circuit
of
this
couple
and
considering
it
under
all
its
aspects
thenardier
had
just
passed
his
fiftieth
birthday
madame
thenardier
was
approaching
her
forties
which
is
equivalent
to
fifty
in
a
woman
so
that
there
existed
a
balance
of
age
between
husband
and
wife
our
readers
have
possibly
preserved
some
recollection
of
this
thenardier
woman
ever
since
her
first
appearance
tall
blond
red
fat
angular
square
enormous
and
agile
she
belonged
as
we
have
said
to
the
race
of
those
colossal
wild
women
who
contort
themselves
at
fairs
with
paving
stones
hanging
from
their
hair
she
did
everything
about
the
house
made
the
beds
did
the
washing
the
cooking
and
everything
else
cosette
was
her
only
servant
a
mouse
in
the
service
of
an
elephant
everything
trembled
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
window
panes
furniture
and
people
her
big
face
dotted
with
red
blotches
presented
the
appearance
of
a
skimmer
she
had
a
beard
she
was
an
ideal
market
porter
dressed
in
woman
s
clothes
she
swore
splendidly
she
boasted
of
being
able
to
crack
a
nut
with
one
blow
of
her
fist
except
for
the
romances
which
she
had
read
and
which
made
the
affected
lady
peep
through
the
ogress
at
times
in
a
very
queer
way
the
idea
would
never
have
occurred
to
any
one
to
say
of
her
that
is
a
woman
this
thenardier
female
was
like
the
product
of
a
wench
engrafted
on
a
fishwife
when
one
heard
her
speak
one
said
that
is
a
gendarme
when
one
saw
her
drink
one
said
that
is
a
carter
when
one
saw
her
handle
cosette
one
said
that
is
the
hangman
one
of
her
teeth
projected
when
her
face
was
in
repose
thenardier
was
a
small
thin
pale
angular
bony
feeble
man
who
had
a
sickly
air
and
who
was
wonderfully
healthy
his
cunning
began
here
he
smiled
habitually
by
way
of
precaution
and
was
almost
polite
to
everybody
even
to
the
beggar
to
whom
he
refused
half
a
farthing
he
had
the
glance
of
a
pole
cat
and
the
bearing
of
a
man
of
letters
he
greatly
resembled
the
portraits
of
the
abbe
delille
his
coquetry
consisted
in
drinking
with
the
carters
no
one
had
ever
succeeded
in
rendering
him
drunk
he
smoked
a
big
pipe
he
wore
a
blouse
and
under
his
blouse
an
old
black
coat
he
made
pretensions
to
literature
and
to
materialism
there
were
certain
names
which
he
often
pronounced
to
support
whatever
things
he
might
be
saying
voltaire
raynal
parny
and
singularly
enough
saint
augustine
he
declared
that
he
had
a
system
in
addition
he
was
a
great
swindler
a
filousophe
philosophe
a
scientific
thief
the
species
does
exist
it
will
be
remembered
that
he
pretended
to
have
served
in
the
army
he
was
in
the
habit
of
relating
with
exuberance
how
being
a
sergeant
in
the
6th
or
the
9th
light
something
or
other
at
waterloo
he
had
alone
and
in
the
presence
of
a
squadron
of
death
dealing
hussars
covered
with
his
body
and
saved
from
death
in
the
midst
of
the
grape
shot
a
general
who
had
been
dangerously
wounded
thence
arose
for
his
wall
the
flaring
sign
and
for
his
inn
the
name
which
it
bore
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
cabaret
of
the
sergeant
of
waterloo
he
was
a
liberal
a
classic
and
a
bonapartist
he
had
subscribed
for
the
champ
d
asile
it
was
said
in
the
village
that
he
had
studied
for
the
priesthood
we
believe
that
he
had
simply
studied
in
holland
for
an
inn
keeper
this
rascal
of
composite
order
was
in
all
probability
some
fleming
from
lille
in
flanders
a
frenchman
in
paris
a
belgian
at
brussels
being
comfortably
astride
of
both
frontiers
as
for
his
prowess
at
waterloo
the
reader
is
already
acquainted
with
that
it
will
be
perceived
that
he
exaggerated
it
a
trifle
ebb
and
flow
wandering
adventure
was
the
leven
of
his
existence
a
tattered
conscience
entails
a
fragmentary
life
and
apparently
at
the
stormy
epoch
of
june
18
1815
thenardier
belonged
to
that
variety
of
marauding
sutlers
of
which
we
have
spoken
beating
about
the
country
selling
to
some
stealing
from
others
and
travelling
like
a
family
man
with
wife
and
children
in
a
rickety
cart
in
the
rear
of
troops
on
the
march
with
an
instinct
for
always
attaching
himself
to
the
victorious
army
this
campaign
ended
and
having
as
he
said
some
quibus
he
had
come
to
montfermeil
and
set
up
an
inn
there
this
quibus
composed
of
purses
and
watches
of
gold
rings
and
silver
crosses
gathered
in
harvest
time
in
furrows
sown
with
corpses
did
not
amount
to
a
large
total
and
did
not
carry
this
sutler
turned
eating
house
keeper
very
far
thenardier
had
that
peculiar
rectilinear
something
about
his
gestures
which
accompanied
by
an
oath
recalls
the
barracks
and
by
a
sign
of
the
cross
the
seminary
he
was
a
fine
talker
he
allowed
it
to
be
thought
that
he
was
an
educated
man
nevertheless
the
schoolmaster
had
noticed
that
he
pronounced
improperly
12
he
composed
the
travellers
tariff
card
in
a
superior
manner
but
practised
eyes
sometimes
spied
out
orthographical
errors
in
it
thenardier
was
cunning
greedy
slothful
and
clever
he
did
not
disdain
his
servants
which
caused
his
wife
to
dispense
with
them
this
giantess
was
jealous
it
seemed
to
her
that
that
thin
and
yellow
little
man
must
be
an
object
coveted
by
all
thenardier
who
was
above
all
an
astute
and
well
balanced
man
was
a
scamp
of
a
temperate
sort
this
is
the
worst
species
hypocrisy
enters
into
it
it
is
not
that
thenardier
was
not
on
occasion
capable
of
wrath
to
quite
the
same
degree
as
his
wife
but
this
was
very
rare
and
at
such
times
since
he
was
enraged
with
the
human
race
in
general
as
he
bore
within
him
a
deep
furnace
of
hatred
and
since
he
was
one
of
those
people
who
are
continually
avenging
their
wrongs
who
accuse
everything
that
passes
before
them
of
everything
which
has
befallen
them
and
who
are
always
ready
to
cast
upon
the
first
person
who
comes
to
hand
as
a
legitimate
grievance
the
sum
total
of
the
deceptions
the
bankruptcies
and
the
calamities
of
their
lives
when
all
this
leaven
was
stirred
up
in
him
and
boiled
forth
from
his
mouth
and
eyes
he
was
terrible
woe
to
the
person
who
came
under
his
wrath
at
such
a
time
in
addition
to
his
other
qualities
thenardier
was
attentive
and
penetrating
silent
or
talkative
according
to
circumstances
and
always
highly
intelligent
he
had
something
of
the
look
of
sailors
who
are
accustomed
to
screw
up
their
eyes
to
gaze
through
marine
glasses
thenardier
was
a
statesman
every
new
comer
who
entered
the
tavern
said
on
catching
sight
of
madame
thenardier
there
is
the
master
of
the
house
a
mistake
she
was
not
even
the
mistress
the
husband
was
both
master
and
mistress
she
worked
he
created
he
directed
everything
by
a
sort
of
invisible
and
constant
magnetic
action
a
word
was
sufficient
for
him
sometimes
a
sign
the
mastodon
obeyed
thenardier
was
a
sort
of
special
and
sovereign
being
in
madame
thenardier
s
eyes
though
she
did
not
thoroughly
realize
it
she
was
possessed
of
virtues
after
her
own
kind
if
she
had
ever
had
a
disagreement
as
to
any
detail
with
monsieur
thenardier
which
was
an
inadmissible
hypothesis
by
the
way
she
would
not
have
blamed
her
husband
in
public
on
any
subject
whatever
she
would
never
have
committed
before
strangers
that
mistake
so
often
committed
by
women
and
which
is
called
in
parliamentary
language
exposing
the
crown
although
their
concord
had
only
evil
as
its
result
there
was
contemplation
in
madame
thenardier
s
submission
to
her
husband
that
mountain
of
noise
and
of
flesh
moved
under
the
little
finger
of
that
frail
despot
viewed
on
its
dwarfed
and
grotesque
side
this
was
that
grand
and
universal
thing
the
adoration
of
mind
by
matter
for
certain
ugly
features
have
a
cause
in
the
very
depths
of
eternal
beauty
there
was
an
unknown
quantity
about
thenardier
hence
the
absolute
empire
of
the
man
over
that
woman
at
certain
moments
she
beheld
him
like
a
lighted
candle
at
others
she
felt
him
like
a
claw
this
woman
was
a
formidable
creature
who
loved
no
one
except
her
children
and
who
did
not
fear
any
one
except
her
husband
she
was
a
mother
because
she
was
mammiferous
but
her
maternity
stopped
short
with
her
daughters
and
as
we
shall
see
did
not
extend
to
boys
the
man
had
but
one
thought
how
to
enrich
himself
he
did
not
succeed
in
this
a
theatre
worthy
of
this
great
talent
was
lacking
thenardier
was
ruining
himself
at
montfermeil
if
ruin
is
possible
to
zero
in
switzerland
or
in
the
pyrenees
this
penniless
scamp
would
have
become
a
millionaire
but
an
inn
keeper
must
browse
where
fate
has
hitched
him
it
will
be
understood
that
the
word
inn
keeper
is
here
employed
in
a
restricted
sense
and
does
not
extend
to
an
entire
class
in
this
same
year
1823
thenardier
was
burdened
with
about
fifteen
hundred
francs
worth
of
petty
debts
and
this
rendered
him
anxious
whatever
may
have
been
the
obstinate
injustice
of
destiny
in
this
case
thenardier
was
one
of
those
men
who
understand
best
with
the
most
profundity
and
in
the
most
modern
fashion
that
thing
which
is
a
virtue
among
barbarous
peoples
and
an
object
of
merchandise
among
civilized
peoples
hospitality
besides
he
was
an
admirable
poacher
and
quoted
for
his
skill
in
shooting
he
had
a
certain
cold
and
tranquil
laugh
which
was
particularly
dangerous
his
theories
as
a
landlord
sometimes
burst
forth
in
lightning
flashes
he
had
professional
aphorisms
which
he
inserted
into
his
wife
s
mind
the
duty
of
the
inn
keeper
he
said
to
her
one
day
violently
and
in
a
low
voice
is
to
sell
to
the
first
comer
stews
repose
light
fire
dirty
sheets
a
servant
lice
and
a
smile
to
stop
passers
by
to
empty
small
purses
and
to
honestly
lighten
heavy
ones
to
shelter
travelling
families
respectfully
to
shave

the
truss
of
straw
to
know
how
much
the
shadow
uses
up
the
mirror
and
to
put
a
price
on
it
and
by
five
hundred
thousand
devils
to
make
the
traveller
pay
for
everything
even
for
the
flies
which
his
dog
eats
this
man
and
this
woman
were
ruse
and
rage
wedded
a
hideous
and
terrible
team
while
the
husband
pondered
and
combined
madame
thenardier
thought
not
of
absent
creditors
took
no
heed
of
yesterday
nor
of
to
morrow
and
lived
in
a
fit
of
anger
all
in
a
minute
such
were
these
two
beings
cosette
was
between
them
subjected
to
their
double
pressure
like
a
creature
who
is
at
the
same
time
being
ground
up
in
a
mill
and
pulled
to
pieces
with
pincers
the
man
and
the
woman
each
had
a
different
method
cosette
was
overwhelmed
with
blows
this
was
the
woman
s
she
went
barefooted
in
winter
that
was
the
man
s
doing
cosette
ran
up

and
down

ran
fluttered
about
panted
moved
heavy
articles
and
weak
as
she
was
did
the
coarse
work
there
was
no
mercy
for
her
a
fierce
mistress
and
venomous
master
the
thenardier
hostelry
was
like
a
spider
s
web
in
which
cosette
had
been
caught
and
where
she
lay
trembling
the
ideal
of
oppression
was
realized
by
this
sinister
household
it
was
something
like
the
fly
serving
the
spiders
the
poor
child
passively
held
her
peace
what
takes
place
within
these
souls
when
they
have
but
just
quitted
god
find
themselves
thus
at
the
very
dawn
of
life
very
small

men
must
have
wine
and
horses
must
have

four
new
travellers
had
arrived
cosette
was
meditating
sadly
for
although
she
was
only
eight
years
old
she
had
already
suffered
so
much
that
she
reflected
with
the
lugubrious
air
of
an
old
woman
her
eye
was
black
in
consequence
of
a
blow
from
madame
thenardier
s
fist
which
caused
the
latter
to
remark
from
time
to
time
how
ugly
she
is
with
her
fist
blow
on
her
eye
cosette
was
thinking
that
it
was
dark
very
dark
that
the
pitchers
and
caraffes
in
the
chambers
of
the
travellers
who
had
arrived
must
have
been
filled
and
that
there
was
no
more
water
in
the
cistern
she
was
somewhat
reassured
because
no
one
in
the
thenardier
establishment
drank
much
water
thirsty
people
were
never
lacking
there
but
their
thirst
was
of
the
sort
which
applies
to
the
jug
rather
than
to
the
pitcher
any
one
who
had
asked
for
a
glass
of
water
among
all
those
glasses
of
wine
would
have
appeared
a
savage
to
all
these
men
but
there
came
a
moment
when
the
child
trembled
madame
thenardier
raised
the
cover
of
a
stew
pan
which
was
boiling
on
the
stove
then
seized
a
glass
and
briskly
approached
the
cistern
she
turned
the
faucet
the
child
had
raised
her
head
and
was
following
all
the
woman
s
movements
a
thin
stream
of
water
trickled
from
the
faucet
and
half
filled
the
glass
well
said
she
there
is
no
more
water
a
momentary
silence
ensued
the
child
did
not
breathe
bah
resumed
madame
thenardier
examining
the
half
filled
glass
this
will
be
enough
cosette
applied
herself
to
her
work
once
more
but
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
felt
her
heart
leaping
in
her
bosom
like
a
big
snow
flake
she
counted
the
minutes
that
passed
in
this
manner
and
wished
it
were
the
next
morning
from
time
to
time
one
of
the
drinkers
looked
into
the
street
and
exclaimed
it
s
as
black
as
an
oven
or
one
must
needs
be
a
cat
to
go
about
the
streets
without
a
lantern
at
this
hour
and
cosette
trembled
all
at
once
one
of
the
pedlers
who
lodged
in
the
hostelry
entered
and
said
in
a
harsh
voice
my
horse
has
not
been
watered
yes
it
has
said
madame
thenardier
i
tell
you
that
it
has
not
retorted
the
pedler
cosette
had
emerged
from
under
the
table
oh
yes
sir
said
she
the
horse
has
had
a
drink
he
drank
out
of
a
bucket
a
whole
bucketful
and
it
was
i
who
took
the
water
to
him
and
i
spoke
to
him
it
was
not
true
cosette
lied
there
s
a
brat
as
big
as
my
fist
who
tells
lies
as
big
as
the
house
exclaimed
the
pedler
i
tell
you
that
he
has
not
been
watered
you
little
jade
he
has
a
way
of
blowing
when
he
has
had
no
water
which
i
know
well
cosette
persisted
and
added
in
a
voice
rendered
hoarse
with
anguish
and
which
was
hardly
audible
and
he
drank
heartily
come
said
the
pedler
in
a
rage
this
won
t
do
at
all
let
my
horse
be
watered
and
let
that
be
the
end
of
it
cosette
crept
under
the
table
again
in
truth
that
is
fair
said
madame
thenardier
if
the
beast
has
not
been
watered
it
must
be
then
glancing
about
her
well
now
where
s
that
other
beast
she
bent
down
and
discovered
cosette
cowering
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
almost
under
the
drinkers
feet
are
you
coming
shrieked
madame
thenardier
cosette
crawled
out
of
the
sort
of
hole
in
which
she
had
hidden
herself
the
thenardier
resumed
mademoiselle
dog
lack
name
go
and
water
that
horse
but
madame
said
cosette
feebly
there
is
no
water
the
thenardier
threw
the
street
door
wide
open
well
go
and
get
some
then
cosette
dropped
her
head
and
went
for
an
empty
bucket
which
stood
near
the
chimney
corner
this
bucket
was
bigger
than
she
was
and
the
child
could
have
set
down
in
it
at
her
ease
the
thenardier
returned
to
her
stove
and
tasted
what
was
in
the
stewpan
with
a
wooden
spoon
grumbling
the
while
there
s
plenty
in
the
spring
there
never
was
such
a
malicious
creature
as
that
i
think
i
should
have
done
better
to
strain
my
onions
then
she
rummaged
in
a
drawer
which
contained
sous
pepper
and
shallots
see
here
mam
selle
toad
she
added
on
your
way
back
you
will
get
a
big
loaf
from
the
baker
here
s
a
fifteen
sou
piece
cosette
had
a
little
pocket
on
one
side
of
her
apron
she
took
the
coin
without
saying
a
word
and
put
it
in
that
pocket
then
she
stood
motionless
bucket
in
hand
the
open
door
before
her
she
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
some
one
to
come
to
her
rescue
get
along
with
you
screamed
the
thenardier
cosette
went
out
the
door
closed
behind
her
chapter
iv

on
the
scene
of
a
doll
the
line
of
open
air
booths
starting
at
the
church
extended
as
the
reader
will
remember
as
far
as
the
hostelry
of
the
thenardiers
these
booths
were
all
illuminated
because
the
citizens
would
soon
pass
on
their
way
to
the
midnight
mass
with
candles
burning
in
paper
funnels
which
as
the
schoolmaster
then
seated
at
the
table
at
the
thenardiers
observed
produced
a
magical
effect
in
compensation
not
a
star
was
visible
in
the
sky
the
last
of
these
stalls
established
precisely
opposite
the
thenardiers
door
was
a
toy
shop
all
glittering
with
tinsel
glass
and
magnificent
objects
of
tin
in
the
first
row
and
far
forwards
the
merchant
had
placed
on
a
background
of
white
napkins
an
immense
doll
nearly
two
feet
high
who
was
dressed
in
a
robe
of
pink
crepe
with
gold
wheat
ears
on
her
head
which
had
real
hair
and
enamel
eyes
all
that
day
this
marvel
had
been
displayed
to
the
wonderment
of
all
passers
by
under
ten
years
of
age
without
a
mother
being
found
in
montfermeil
sufficiently
rich
or
sufficiently
extravagant
to
give
it
to
her
child
eponine
and
azelma
had
passed
hours
in
contemplating
it
and
cosette
herself
had
ventured
to
cast
a
glance
at
it
on
the
sly
it
is
true
at
the
moment
when
cosette
emerged
bucket
in
hand
melancholy
and
overcome
as
she
was
she
could
not
refrain
from
lifting
her
eyes
to
that
wonderful
doll
towards
the
lady
as
she
called
it
the
poor
child
paused
in
amazement
she
had
not
yet
beheld
that
doll
close
to
the
whole
shop
seemed
a
palace
to
her
the
doll
was
not
a
doll
it
was
a
vision
it
was
joy
splendor
riches
happiness
which
appeared
in
a
sort
of
chimerical
halo
to
that
unhappy
little
being
so
profoundly
engulfed
in
gloomy
and
chilly
misery
with
the
sad
and
innocent
sagacity
of
childhood
cosette
measured
the
abyss
which
separated
her
from
that
doll
she
said
to
herself
that
one
must
be
a
queen
or
at
least
a
princess
to
have
a
thing
like
that
she
gazed
at
that
beautiful
pink
dress
that
beautiful
smooth
hair
and
she
thought
how
happy
that
doll
must
be
she
could
not
take
her
eyes
from
that
fantastic
stall
the
more
she
looked
the
more
dazzled
she
grew
she
thought
she
was
gazing
at
paradise
there
were
other
dolls
behind
the
large
one
which
seemed
to
her
to
be
fairies
and
genii
the
merchant
who
was
pacing
back
and
forth
in
front
of
his
shop
produced
on
her
somewhat
the
effect
of
being
the
eternal
father
in
this
adoration
she
forgot
everything
even
the
errand
with
which
she
was
charged
all
at
once
the
thenardier
s
coarse
voice
recalled
her
to
reality
what
you
silly
jade
you
have
not
gone
wait
i
ll
give
it
to
you
i
want
to
know
what
you
are
doing
there
get
along
you
little
monster
the
thenardier
had
cast
a
glance
into
the
street
and
had
caught
sight
of
cosette
in
her
ecstasy
cosette
fled
dragging
her
pail
and
taking
the
longest
strides
of
which
she
was
capable
chapter
v
the
little
one
all
alone
as
the
thenardier
hostelry
was
in
that
part
of
the
village
which
is
near
the
church
it
was
to
the
spring
in
the
forest
in
the
direction
of
chelles
that
cosette
was
obliged
to
go
for
her
water
she
did
not
glance
at
the
display
of
a
single
other
merchant
so
long
as
she
was
in
boulanger
lane
and
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
church
the
lighted
stalls
illuminated
the
road
but
soon
the
last
light
from
the
last
stall
vanished
the
poor
child
found
herself
in
the
dark
she
plunged
into
it
only
as
a
certain
emotion
overcame
her
she
made
as
much
motion
as
possible
with
the
handle
of
the
bucket
as
she
walked
along
this
made
a
noise
which
afforded
her
company
the
further
she
went
the
denser
the
darkness
became
there
was
no
one
in
the
streets
however
she
did
encounter
a
woman
who
turned
around
on
seeing
her
and
stood
still
muttering
between
her
teeth
where
can
that
child
be
going
is
it
a
werewolf
child
then
the
woman
recognized
cosette
well
said
she
it
s
the
lark
in
this
manner
cosette
traversed
the
labyrinth
of
tortuous
and
deserted
streets
which
terminate
in
the
village
of
montfermeil
on
the
side
of
chelles
so
long
as
she
had
the
houses
or
even
the
walls
only
on
both
sides
of
her
path
she
proceeded
with
tolerable
boldness
from
time
to
time
she
caught
the
flicker
of
a
candle
through
the
crack
of
a
shutter
this
was
light
and
life
there
were
people
there
and
it
reassured
her
but
in
proportion
as
she
advanced
her
pace
slackened
mechanically
as
it
were
when
she
had
passed
the
corner
of
the
last
house
cosette
paused
it
had
been
hard
to
advance
further
than
the
last
stall
it
became
impossible
to
proceed
further
than
the
last
house
she
set
her
bucket
on
the
ground
thrust
her
hand
into
her
hair
and
began
slowly
to
scratch
her
head
a
gesture
peculiar
to
children
when
terrified
and
undecided
what
to
do
it
was
no
longer
montfermeil
it
was
the
open
fields
black
and
desert
space
was
before
her
she
gazed
in
despair
at
that
darkness
where
there
was
no
longer
any
one
where
there
were
beasts
where
there
were
spectres
possibly
she
took
a
good
look
and
heard
the
beasts
walking
on
the
grass
and
she
distinctly
saw
spectres
moving
in
the
trees
then
she
seized
her
bucket
again
fear
had
lent
her
audacity
bah
said
she
i
will
tell
him
that
there
was
no
more
water
and
she
resolutely
re
entered
montfermeil
hardly
had
she
gone
a
hundred
paces
when
she
paused
and
began
to
scratch
her
head
again
now
it
was
the
thenardier
who
appeared
to
her
with
her
hideous
hyena
mouth
and
wrath
flashing
in
her
eyes
the
child
cast
a
melancholy
glance
before
her
and
behind
her
what
was
she
to
do
what
was
to
become
of
her
where
was
she
to
go
in
front
of
her
was
the
spectre
of
the
thenardier
behind
her
all
the
phantoms
of
the
night
and
of
the
forest
it
was
before
the
thenardier
that
she
recoiled
she
resumed
her
path
to
the
spring
and
began
to
run
she
emerged
from
the
village
she
entered
the
forest
at
a
run
no
longer
looking
at
or
listening
to
anything
she
only
paused
in
her
course
when
her
breath
failed
her
but
she
did
not
halt
in
her
advance
she
went
straight
before
her
in
desperation
as
she
ran
she
felt
like
crying
the
nocturnal
quivering
of
the
forest
surrounded
her
completely
she
no
longer
thought
she
no
longer
saw
the
immensity
of
night
was
facing
this
tiny
creature
on
the
one
hand
all
shadow
on
the
other
an
atom
it
was
only
seven
or
eight
minutes
walk
from
the
edge
of
the
woods
to
the
spring
cosette
knew
the
way
through
having
gone
over
it
many
times
in
daylight
strange
to
say
she
did
not
get
lost
a
remnant
of
instinct
guided
her
vaguely
but
she
did
not
turn
her
eyes
either
to
right
or
to
left
for
fear
of
seeing
things
in
the
branches
and
in
the
brushwood
in
this
manner
she
reached
the
spring
it
was
a
narrow
natural
basin
hollowed
out
by
the
water
in
a
clayey
soil
about
two
feet
deep
surrounded
with
moss
and
with
those
tall
crimped
grasses
which
are
called
henry
iv
s
frills
and
paved
with
several
large
stones
a
brook
ran
out
of
it
with
a
tranquil
little
noise
cosette
did
not
take
time
to
breathe
it
was
very
dark
but
she
was
in
the
habit
of
coming
to
this
spring
she
felt
with
her
left
hand
in
the
dark
for
a
young
oak
which
leaned
over
the
spring
and
which
usually
served
to
support
her
found
one
of
its
branches
clung
to
it
bent
down
and
plunged
the
bucket
in
the
water
she
was
in
a
state
of
such
violent
excitement
that
her
strength
was
trebled
while
thus
bent
over
she
did
not
notice
that
the
pocket
of
her
apron
had
emptied
itself
into
the
spring
the
fifteen
sou
piece
fell
into
the
water
cosette
neither
saw
nor
heard
it
fall
she
drew
out
the
bucket
nearly
full
and
set
it
on
the
grass
that
done
she
perceived
that
she
was
worn
out
with
fatigue
she
would
have
liked
to
set
out
again
at
once
but
the
effort
required
to
fill
the
bucket
had
been
such
that
she
found
it
impossible
to
take
a
step
she
was
forced
to
sit
down
she
dropped
on
the
grass
and
remained
crouching
there
she
shut
her
eyes
then
she
opened
them
again
without
knowing
why
but
because
she
could
not
do
otherwise
the
agitated
water
in
the
bucket
beside
her
was
describing
circles
which
resembled
tin
serpents
overhead
the
sky
was
covered
with
vast
black
clouds
which
were
like
masses
of
smoke
the
tragic
mask
of
shadow
seemed
to
bend
vaguely
over
the
child
jupiter
was
setting
in
the
depths
the
child
stared
with
bewildered
eyes
at
this
great
star
with
which
she
was
unfamiliar
and
which
terrified
her
the
planet
was
in
fact
very
near
the
horizon
and
was
traversing
a
dense
layer
of
mist
which
imparted
to
it
a
horrible
ruddy
hue
the
mist
gloomily
empurpled
magnified
the
star
one
would
have
called
it
a
luminous
wound
a
cold
wind
was
blowing
from
the
plain
the
forest
was
dark
not
a
leaf
was
moving
there
were
none
of
the
vague
fresh
gleams
of
summertide
great
boughs
uplifted
themselves
in
frightful
wise
slender
and
misshapen
bushes
whistled
in
the
clearings
the
tall
grasses
undulated
like
eels
under
the
north
wind
the
nettles
seemed
to
twist
long
arms
furnished
with
claws
in
search
of
prey
some
bits
of
dry
heather
tossed
by
the
breeze
flew
rapidly
by
and
had
the
air
of
fleeing
in
terror
before
something
which
was
coming
after
on
all
sides
there
were
lugubrious
stretches
the
darkness
was
bewildering

no

long

against
all
this
one
has
no
protection
there
is
no
hardihood
which
does
not
shudder
and
which
does
not
feel
the
vicinity
of
anguish
one
is
conscious
of
something
hideous
as
though
one
s
soul
were
becoming
amalgamated
with
the
darkness
this
penetration
of
the
shadows
is
indescribably
sinister
in
the
case
of
a
child
forests
are
apocalypses
and
the
beating
of
the
wings
of
a
tiny
soul
produces
a
sound
of
agony
beneath
their
monstrous
vault
without
understanding
her
sensations
cosette
was
conscious
that
she
was
seized
upon
by
that
black
enormity
of
nature
it
was
no
longer
terror
alone
which
was
gaining
possession
of
her
it
was
something
more
terrible
even
than
terror
she
shivered
there
are
no
words
to
express
the
strangeness
of
that
shiver
which
chilled
her
to
the
very
bottom
of
her
heart
her
eye
grew
wild
she
thought
she
felt
that
she
should
not
be
able
to
refrain
from
returning
there
at
the
same
hour
on
the
morrow
then
by
a
sort
of
instinct
she
began
to
count
aloud
one
two
three
four
and
so
on
up
to
ten
in
order
to
escape
from
that
singular
state
which
she
did
not
understand
but
which
terrified
her
and
when
she
had
finished
she
began
again
this
restored
her
to
a
true
perception
of
the
things
about
her
her
hands
which
she
had
wet
in
drawing
the
water
felt
cold
she
rose
her
terror
a
natural
and
unconquerable
terror
had
returned
she
had
but
one
thought
now
to
flee
at
full
speed
through
the
forest
across
the
fields
to
the
houses
to
the
windows
to
the
lighted
candles
her
glance
fell
upon
the
water
which
stood
before
her
such
was
the
fright
which
the
thenardier
inspired
in
her
that
she
dared
not
flee
without
that
bucket
of
water
she
seized
the
handle
with
both
hands
she
could
hardly
lift
the
pail
in
this
manner
she
advanced
a
dozen
paces
but
the
bucket
was
full
it
was
heavy
she
was
forced
to
set
it
on
the
ground
once
more
she
took
breath
for
an
instant
then
lifted
the
handle
of
the
bucket
again
and
resumed
her
march
proceeding
a
little
further
this
time
but
again
she
was
obliged
to
pause
after
some
seconds
of
repose
she
set
out
again
she
walked
bent
forward
with
drooping
head
like
an
old
woman
the
weight
of
the
bucket
strained
and
stiffened
her
thin
arms
the
iron
handle
completed
the
benumbing
and
freezing
of
her
wet
and
tiny
hands
she
was
forced
to
halt
from
time
to
time
and
each
time
that
she
did
so
the
cold
water
which
splashed
from
the
pail
fell
on
her
bare
legs
this
took
place
in
the
depths
of
a
forest
at
night
in
winter
far
from
all
human
sight
she
was
a
child
of
eight
no
one
but
god
saw
that
sad
thing
at
the
moment
and
her
mother
no
doubt
alas
for
there
are
things
that
make
the
dead
open
their
eyes
in
their
graves
she
panted
with
a
sort
of
painful
rattle
sobs
contracted
her
throat
but
she
dared
not
weep
so
afraid
was
she
of
the
thenardier
even
at
a
distance
it
was
her
custom
to
imagine
the
thenardier
always
present
however
she
could
not
make
much
headway
in
that
manner
and
she
went
on
very
slowly
in
spite
of
diminishing
the
length
of
her
stops
and
of
walking
as
long
as
possible
between
them
she
reflected
with
anguish
that
it
would
take
her
more
than
an
hour
to
return
to
montfermeil
in
this
manner
and
that
the
thenardier
would
beat
her
this
anguish
was
mingled
with
her
terror
at
being
alone
in
the
woods
at
night
she
was
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
had
not
yet
emerged
from
the
forest
on
arriving
near
an
old
chestnut
tree
with
which
she
was
acquainted
made
a
last
halt
longer
than
the
rest
in
order
that
she
might
get
well
rested
then
she
summoned
up
all
her
strength
picked
up
her
bucket
again
and
courageously
resumed
her
march
but
the
poor
little
desperate
creature
could
not
refrain
from
crying
o
my
god
my
god
at
that
moment
she
suddenly
became
conscious
that
her
bucket
no
longer
weighed
anything
at
all
a
hand
which
seemed
to
her
enormous
had
just
seized
the
handle
and
lifted
it
vigorously
she
raised
her
head
a
large
black
form
straight
and
erect
was
walking
beside
her
through
the
darkness
it
was
a
man
who
had
come
up
behind
her
and
whose
approach
she
had
not
heard
this
man
without
uttering
a
word
had
seized
the
handle
of
the
bucket
which
she
was
carrying
there
are
instincts
for
all
the
encounters
of
life
the
child
was
not
afraid
chapter
vi
which
possibly
proves
boulatruelle
s
intelligence
on
the
afternoon
of
that
same
christmas
day
1823
a
man
had
walked
for
rather
a
long
time
in
the
most
deserted
part
of
the
boulevard
de
l
hopital
in
paris
this
man
had
the
air
of
a
person
who
is
seeking
lodgings
and
he
seemed
to
halt
by
preference
at
the
most
modest
houses
on
that
dilapidated
border
of
the
faubourg
saint
marceau
we
shall
see
further
on
that
this
man
had
in
fact
hired
a
chamber
in
that
isolated
quarter
this
man
in
his
attire
as
in
all
his
person
realized
the
type
of
what
may
be
called
the
well
bred
mendicant
extreme
wretchedness
combined
with
extreme
cleanliness
this
is
a
very
rare
mixture
which
inspires
intelligent
hearts
with
that
double
respect
which
one
feels
for
the
man
who
is
very
poor
and
for
the
man
who
is
very
worthy
he
wore
a
very
old
and
very
well
brushed
round
hat
a
coarse
coat
worn
perfectly
threadbare
of
an
ochre
yellow
a
color
that
was
not
in
the
least
eccentric
at
that
epoch
a
large
waistcoat
with
pockets
of
a
venerable
cut
black
breeches
worn
gray
at
the
knee
stockings
of
black
worsted
and
thick
shoes
with
copper
buckles
he
would
have
been
pronounced
a
preceptor
in
some
good
family
returned
from
the
emigration
he
would
have
been
taken
for
more
than
sixty
years
of
age
from
his
perfectly
white
hair
his
wrinkled
brow
his
livid
lips
and
his
countenance
where
everything
breathed
depression
and
weariness
of
life
judging
from
his
firm
tread
from
the
singular
vigor
which
stamped
all
his
movements
he
would
have
hardly
been
thought
fifty
the
wrinkles
on
his
brow
were
well
placed
and
would
have
disposed
in
his
favor
any
one
who
observed
him
attentively
his
lip
contracted
with
a
strange
fold
which
seemed
severe
and
which
was
humble
there
was
in
the
depth
of
his
glance
an
indescribable
melancholy
serenity
in
his
left
hand
he
carried
a
little
bundle
tied
up
in
a
handkerchief
in
his
right
he
leaned
on
a
sort
of
a
cudgel
cut
from
some
hedge
this
stick
had
been
carefully
trimmed
and
had
an
air
that
was
not
too
threatening
the
most
had
been
made
of
its
knots
and
it
had
received
a
coral
like
head
made
from
red
wax
it
was
a
cudgel
and
it
seemed
to
be
a
cane
there
are
but
few
passers
by
on
that
boulevard
particularly
in
the
winter
the
man
seemed
to
avoid
them
rather
than
to
seek
them
but
this
without
any
affectation
at
that
epoch
king
louis
xviii
went
nearly
every
day
to
choisy
le
roi
it
was
one
of
his
favorite
excursions
towards
two
o
clock
almost
invariably
the
royal
carriage
and
cavalcade
was
seen
to
pass
at
full
speed
along
the
boulevard
de
l
hopital
this
served
in
lieu
of
a
watch
or
clock
to
the
poor
women
of
the
quarter
who
said
it
is
two
o
clock
there
he
is
returning
to
the
tuileries
and
some
rushed
forward
and
others
drew
up
in
line
for
a
passing
king
always
creates
a
tumult
besides
the
appearance
and
disappearance
of
louis
xviii
produced
a
certain
effect
in
the
streets
of
paris
it
was
rapid
but
majestic
this
impotent
king
had
a
taste
for
a
fast
gallop
as
he
was
not
able
to
walk
he
wished
to
run
that
cripple
would
gladly
have
had
himself
drawn
by
the
lightning
he
passed
pacific
and
severe
in
the
midst
of
naked
swords
his
massive
coach
all
covered
with
gilding
with
great
branches
of
lilies
painted
on
the
panels
thundered
noisily
along
there
was
hardly
time
to
cast
a
glance
upon
it
in
the
rear
angle
on
the
right
there
was
visible
on
tufted
cushions
of
white
satin
a
large
firm
and
ruddy
face
a
brow
freshly
powdered
a
l
oiseau
royal
a
proud
hard
crafty
eye
the
smile
of
an
educated
man
two
great
epaulets
with
bullion
fringe
floating
over
a
bourgeois
coat
the
golden
fleece
the
cross
of
saint
louis
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
the
silver
plaque
of
the
saint
esprit
a
huge
belly
and
a
wide
blue
ribbon
it
was
the
king
outside
of
paris
he
held
his
hat
decked
with
white
ostrich
plumes
on
his
knees
enwrapped
in
high
english
gaiters
when
he
re
entered
the
city
he
put
on
his
hat
and
saluted
rarely
he
stared
coldly
at
the
people
and
they
returned
it
in
kind
when
he
appeared
for
the
first
time
in
the
saint
marceau
quarter
the
whole
success
which
he
produced
is
contained
in
this
remark
of
an
inhabitant
of
the
faubourg
to
his
comrade
that
big
fellow
yonder
is
the
government
this
infallible
passage
of
the
king
at
the
same
hour
was
therefore
the
daily
event
of
the
boulevard
de
l
hopital
the
promenader
in
the
yellow
coat
evidently
did
not
belong
in
the
quarter
and
probably
did
not
belong
in
paris
for
he
was
ignorant
as
to
this
detail
when
at
two
o
clock
the
royal
carriage
surrounded
by
a
squadron
of
the
body
guard
all
covered
with
silver
lace
debouched
on
the
boulevard
after
having
made
the
turn
of
the
salpetriere
he
appeared
surprised
and
almost
alarmed
there
was
no
one
but
himself
in
this
cross
lane
he
drew
up
hastily
behind
the
corner
of
the
wall
of
an
enclosure
though
this
did
not
prevent
m
le
duc
de
havre
from
spying
him

de
havre
as
captain
of
the
guard
on
duty
that
day
was
seated
in
the
carriage
opposite
the
king
he
said
to
his
majesty
yonder
is
an
evil
looking
man
members
of
the
police
who
were
clearing
the
king
s
route
took
equal
note
of
him
one
of
them
received
an
order
to
follow
him
but
the
man
plunged
into
the
deserted
little
streets
of
the
faubourg
and
as
twilight
was
beginning
to
fall
the
agent
lost
trace
of
him
as
is
stated
in
a
report
addressed
that
same
evening
to
m
le
comte
d
angles
minister
of
state
prefect
of
police
when
the
man
in
the
yellow
coat
had
thrown
the
agent
off
his
track
he
redoubled
his
pace
not
without
turning
round
many
a
time
to
assure
himself
that
he
was
not
being
followed
at
a
quarter
past
four
that
is
to
say
when
night
was
fully
come
he
passed
in
front
of
the
theatre
of
the
porte
saint
martin
where
the
two
convicts
was
being
played
that
day
this
poster
illuminated
by
the
theatre
lanterns
struck
him
for
although
he
was
walking
rapidly
he
halted
to
read
it
an
instant
later
he
was
in
the
blind
alley
of
la
planchette
and
he
entered
the
plat
d
etain
the
pewter
platter
where
the
office
of
the
coach
for
lagny
was
then
situated
this
coach
set
out
at
half
past
four
the
horses
were
harnessed
and
the
travellers
summoned
by
the
coachman
were
hastily
climbing
the
lofty
iron
ladder
of
the
vehicle
the
man
inquired
have
you
a
place
only
one
beside
me
on
the
box
said
the
coachman
i
will
take
it
climb
up
nevertheless
before
setting
out
the
coachman
cast
a
glance
at
the
traveller
s
shabby
dress
at
the
diminutive
size
of
his
bundle
and
made
him
pay
his
fare
are
you
going
as
far
as
lagny
demanded
the
coachman
yes
said
the
man
the
traveller
paid
to
lagny
they
started
when
they
had
passed
the
barrier
the
coachman
tried
to
enter
into
conversation
but
the
traveller
only
replied
in
monosyllables
the
coachman
took
to
whistling
and
swearing
at
his
horses
the
coachman
wrapped
himself
up
in
his
cloak
it
was
cold
the
man
did
not
appear
to
be
thinking
of
that
thus
they
passed
gournay
and
neuilly
sur
marne
towards
six
o
clock
in
the
evening
they
reached
chelles
the
coachman
drew
up
in
front
of
the
carters
inn
installed
in
the
ancient
buildings
of
the
royal
abbey
to
give
his
horses
a
breathing
spell
i
get
down
here
said
the
man
he
took
his
bundle
and
his
cudgel
and
jumped
down
from
the
vehicle
an
instant
later
he
had
disappeared
he
did
not
enter
the
inn
when
the
coach
set
out
for
lagny
a
few
minutes
later
it
did
not
encounter
him
in
the
principal
street
of
chelles
the
coachman
turned
to
the
inside
travellers
there
said
he
is
a
man
who
does
not
belong
here
for
i
do
not
know
him
he
had
not
the
air
of
owning
a
sou
but
he
does
not
consider
money
he
pays
to
lagny
and
he
goes
only
as
far
as
chelles
it
is
night
all
the
houses
are
shut
he
does
not
enter
the
inn
and
he
is
not
to
be
found
so
he
has
dived
through
the
earth
the
man
had
not
plunged
into
the
earth
but
he
had
gone
with
great
strides
through
the
dark
down
the
principal
street
of
chelles
then
he
had
turned
to
the
right
before
reaching
the
church
into
the
cross
road
leading
to
montfermeil
like
a
person
who
was
acquainted
with
the
country
and
had
been
there
before
he
followed
this
road
rapidly
at
the
spot
where
it
is
intersected
by
the
ancient
tree
bordered
road
which
runs
from
gagny
to
lagny
he
heard
people
coming
he
concealed
himself
precipitately
in
a
ditch
and
there
waited
until
the
passers
by
were
at
a
distance
the
precaution
was
nearly
superfluous
however
for
as
we
have
already
said
it
was
a
very
dark
december
night
not
more
than
two
or
three
stars
were
visible
in
the
sky
it
is
at
this
point
that
the
ascent
of
the
hill
begins
the
man
did
not
return
to
the
road
to
montfermeil
he
struck
across
the
fields
to
the
right
and
entered
the
forest
with
long
strides
once
in
the
forest
he
slackened
his
pace
and
began
a
careful
examination
of
all
the
trees
advancing
step
by
step
as
though
seeking
and
following
a
mysterious
road
known
to
himself
alone
there
came
a
moment
when
he
appeared
to
lose
himself
and
he
paused
in
indecision
at
last
he
arrived
by
dint
of
feeling
his
way
inch
by
inch
at
a
clearing
where
there
was
a
great
heap
of
whitish
stones
he
stepped
up
briskly
to
these
stones
and
examined
them
attentively
through
the
mists
of
night
as
though
he
were
passing
them
in
review
a
large
tree
covered
with
those
excrescences
which
are
the
warts
of
vegetation
stood
a
few
paces
distant
from
the
pile
of
stones
he
went
up
to
this
tree
and
passed
his
hand
over
the
bark
of
the
trunk
as
though
seeking
to
recognize
and
count
all
the
warts
opposite
this
tree
which
was
an
ash
there
was
a
chestnut
tree
suffering
from
a
peeling
of
the
bark
to
which
a
band
of
zinc
had
been
nailed
by
way
of
dressing
he
raised
himself
on
tiptoe
and
touched
this
band
of
zinc
then
he
trod
about
for
awhile
on
the
ground
comprised
in
the
space
between
the
tree
and
the
heap
of
stones
like
a
person
who
is
trying
to
assure
himself
that
the
soil
has
not
recently
been
disturbed
that
done
he
took
his
bearings
and
resumed
his
march
through
the
forest
it
was
the
man
who
had
just
met
cosette
as
he
walked
through
the
thicket
in
the
direction
of
montfermeil
he
had
espied
that
tiny
shadow
moving
with
a
groan
depositing
a
burden
on
the
ground
then
taking
it
up
and
setting
out
again
he
drew
near
and
perceived
that
it
was
a
very
young
child
laden
with
an
enormous
bucket
of
water
then
he
approached
the
child
and
silently
grasped
the
handle
of
the
bucket
chapter
vii
cosette
side
by
side
with
the
stranger
in
the
dark
cosette
as
we
have
said
was
not
frightened
the
man
accosted
her
he
spoke
in
a
voice
that
was
grave
and
almost
bass
my
child
what
you
are
carrying
is
very
heavy
for
you
cosette
raised
her
head
and
replied
yes
sir
give
it
to
me
said
the
man
i
will
carry
it
for
you
cosette
let
go
of
the
bucket
handle
the
man
walked
along
beside
her
it
really
is
very
heavy
he
muttered
between
his
teeth
then
he
added
how
old
are
you
little
one
eight
sir
and
have
you
come
from
far
like
this
from
the
spring
in
the
forest
are
you
going
far
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
s
walk
from
here
the
man
said
nothing
for
a
moment
then
he
remarked
abruptly
so
you
have
no
mother
i
don
t
know
answered
the
child
before
the
man
had
time
to
speak
again
she
added
i
don
t
think
so
other
people
have
mothers
i
have
none
and
after
a
silence
she
went
on
i
think
that
i
never
had
any
the
man
halted
he
set
the
bucket
on
the
ground
bent
down
and
placed
both
hands
on
the
child
s
shoulders
making
an
effort
to
look
at
her
and
to
see
her
face
in
the
dark
cosette
s
thin
and
sickly
face
was
vaguely
outlined
by
the
livid
light
in
the
sky
what
is
your
name
said
the
man
cosette
the
man
seemed
to
have
received
an
electric
shock
he
looked
at
her
once
more
then
he
removed
his
hands
from
cosette
s
shoulders
seized
the
bucket
and
set
out
again
after
a
moment
he
inquired
where
do
you
live
little
one
at
montfermeil
if
you
know
where
that
is
that
is
where
we
are
going
yes
sir
he
paused
then
began
again
who
sent
you
at
such
an
hour
to
get
water
in
the
forest
it
was
madame
thenardier
the
man
resumed
in
a
voice
which
he
strove
to
render
indifferent
but
in
which
there
was
nevertheless
a
singular
tremor
what
does
your
madame
thenardier
do
she
is
my
mistress
said
the
child
she
keeps
the
inn
the
inn
said
the
man
well
i
am
going
to
lodge
there
to
night
show
me
the
way
we
are
on
the
way
there
said
the
child
the
man
walked
tolerably
fast
cosette
followed
him
without
difficulty
she
no
longer
felt
any
fatigue
from
time
to
time
she
raised
her
eyes
towards
the
man
with
a
sort
of
tranquillity
and
an
indescribable
confidence
she
had
never
been
taught
to
turn
to
providence
and
to
pray
nevertheless
she
felt
within
her
something
which
resembled
hope
and
joy
and
which
mounted
towards
heaven
several
minutes
elapsed
the
man
resumed
is
there
no
servant
in
madame
thenardier
s
house
no
sir
are
you
alone
there
yes
sir
another
pause
ensued
cosette
lifted
up
her
voice
that
is
to
say
there
are
two
little
girls
what
little
girls
ponine
and
zelma
this
was
the
way
the
child
simplified
the
romantic
names
so
dear
to
the
female
thenardier
who
are
ponine
and
zelma
they
are
madame
thenardier
s
young
ladies
her
daughters
as
you
would
say
and
what
do
those
girls
do
oh
said
the
child
they
have
beautiful
dolls
things
with
gold
in
them
all
full
of
affairs
they
play
they
amuse
themselves
all
day
long
yes
sir
and
you
i
i
work
all
day
long
the
child
raised
her
great
eyes
in
which
hung
a
tear
which
was
not
visible
because
of
the
darkness
and
replied
gently
yes
sir
after
an
interval
of
silence
she
went
on
sometimes
when
i
have
finished
my
work
and
they
let
me
i
amuse
myself
too
how
do
you
amuse
yourself
in
the
best
way
i
can
they
let
me
alone
but
i
have
not
many
playthings
ponine
and
zelma
will
not
let
me
play
with
their
dolls
i
have
only
a
little
lead
sword
no
longer
than
that
the
child
held
up
her
tiny
finger
and
it
will
not
cut
yes
sir
said
the
child
it
cuts
salad
and
the
heads
of
flies
they
reached
the
village
cosette
guided
the
stranger
through
the
streets
they
passed
the
bakeshop
but
cosette
did
not
think
of
the
bread
which
she
had
been
ordered
to
fetch
the
man
had
ceased
to
ply
her
with
questions
and
now
preserved
a
gloomy
silence
when
they
had
left
the
church
behind
them
the
man
on
perceiving
all
the
open
air
booths
asked
cosette
so
there
is
a
fair
going
on
here
no
sir
it
is
christmas
as
they
approached
the
tavern
cosette
timidly
touched
his
arm
monsieur
what
my
child
we
are
quite
near
the
house
well
will
you
let
me
take
my
bucket
now
why
if
madame
sees
that
some
one
has
carried
it
for
me
she
will
beat
me
the
man
handed
her
the
bucket
an
instant
later
they
were
at
the
tavern
door
chapter
viii
the
unpleasantness
of
receiving
into
one
s
house
a
poor
man
who
may
be
a
rich
man
cosette
could
not
refrain
from
casting
a
sidelong
glance
at
the
big
doll
which
was
still
displayed
at
the
toy
merchant
s
then
she
knocked
the
door
opened
the
thenardier
appeared
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
ah
so
it
s
you
you
little
wretch
good
mercy
but
you
ve
taken
your
time
the
hussy
has
been
amusing
herself
madame
said
cosette
trembling
all
over
here
s
a
gentleman
who
wants
a
lodging
the
thenardier
speedily
replaced
her
gruff
air
by
her
amiable
grimace
a
change
of
aspect
common
to
tavern
keepers
and
eagerly
sought
the
new
comer
with
her
eyes
this
is
the
gentleman
said
she
yes
madame
replied
the
man
raising
his
hand
to
his
hat
wealthy
travellers
are
not
so
polite
this
gesture
and
an
inspection
of
the
stranger
s
costume
and
baggage
which
the
thenardier
passed
in
review
with
one
glance
caused
the
amiable
grimace
to
vanish
and
the
gruff
mien
to
reappear
she
resumed
dryly
enter
my
good
man
the
good
man
entered
the
thenardier
cast
a
second
glance
at
him
paid
particular
attention
to
his
frock
coat
which
was
absolutely
threadbare
and
to
his
hat
which
was
a
little
battered
and
tossing
her
head
wrinkling
her
nose
and
screwing
up
her
eyes
she
consulted
her
husband
who
was
still
drinking
with
the
carters
the
husband
replied
by
that
imperceptible
movement
of
the
forefinger
which
backed
up
by
an
inflation
of
the
lips
signifies
in
such
cases
a
regular
beggar
thereupon
the
thenardier
exclaimed
ah
see
here
my
good
man
i
am
very
sorry
but
i
have
no
room
left
put
me
where
you
like
said
the
man
in
the
attic
in
the
stable
i
will
pay
as
though
i
occupied
a
room
forty
sous
forty
sous
agreed
very
well
then
forty
sous
said
a
carter
in
a
low
tone
to
the
thenardier
woman
why
the
charge
is
only
twenty
sous
it
is
forty
in
his
case
retorted
the
thenardier
in
the
same
tone
i
don
t
lodge
poor
folks
for
less
that
s
true
added
her
husband
gently
it
ruins
a
house
to
have
such
people
in
it
in
the
meantime
the
man
laying
his
bundle
and
his
cudgel
on
a
bench
had
seated
himself
at
a
table
on
which
cosette
made
haste
to
place
a
bottle
of
wine
and
a
glass
the
merchant
who
had
demanded
the
bucket
of
water
took
it
to
his
horse
himself
cosette
resumed
her
place
under
the
kitchen
table
and
her
knitting
the
man
who
had
barely
moistened
his
lips
in
the
wine
which
he
had
poured
out
for
himself
observed
the
child
with
peculiar
attention
cosette
was
ugly
if
she
had
been
happy
she
might
have
been
pretty
we
have
already
given
a
sketch
of
that
sombre
little
figure
cosette
was
thin
and
pale
she
was
nearly
eight
years
old
but
she
seemed
to
be
hardly
six
her
large
eyes
sunken
in
a
sort
of
shadow
were
almost
put
out
with
weeping
the
corners
of
her
mouth
had
that
curve
of
habitual
anguish
which
is
seen
in
condemned
persons
and
desperately
sick
people
her
hands
were
as
her
mother
had
divined
ruined
with
chilblains
the
fire
which
illuminated
her
at
that
moment
brought
into
relief
all
the
angles
of
her
bones
and
rendered
her
thinness
frightfully
apparent
as
she
was
always
shivering
she
had
acquired
the
habit
of
pressing
her
knees
one
against
the
other
her
entire
clothing
was
but
a
rag
which
would
have
inspired
pity
in
summer
and
which
inspired
horror
in
winter
all
she
had
on
was
hole
ridden
linen
not
a
scrap
of
woollen
her
skin
was
visible
here
and
there
and
everywhere
black
and
blue
spots
could
be
descried
which
marked
the
places
where
the
thenardier
woman
had
touched
her
her
naked
legs
were
thin
and
red
the
hollows
in
her
neck
were
enough
to
make
one
weep
this
child
s
whole
person
her
mien
her
attitude
the
sound
of
her
voice
the
intervals
which
she
allowed
to
elapse
between
one
word
and
the
next
her
glance
her
silence
her
slightest
gesture
expressed
and
betrayed
one
sole
idea
fear
fear
was
diffused
all
over
her
she
was
covered
with
it
so
to
speak
fear
drew
her
elbows
close
to
her
hips
withdrew
her
heels
under
her
petticoat
made
her
occupy
as
little
space
as
possible
allowed
her
only
the
breath
that
was
absolutely
necessary
and
had
become
what
might
be
called
the
habit
of
her
body
admitting
of
no
possible
variation
except
an
increase
in
the
depths
of
her
eyes
there
was
an
astonished
nook
where
terror
lurked
her
fear
was
such
that
on
her
arrival
wet
as
she
was
cosette
did
not
dare
to
approach
the
fire
and
dry
herself
but
sat
silently
down
to
her
work
again
the
expression
in
the
glance
of
that
child
of
eight
years
was
habitually
so
gloomy
and
at
times
so
tragic
that
it
seemed
at
certain
moments
as
though
she
were
on
the
verge
of
becoming
an
idiot
or
a
demon
as
we
have
stated
she
had
never
known
what
it
is
to
pray
she
had
never
set
foot
in
a
church
have
i
the
time
said
the
thenardier
the
man
in
the
yellow
coat
never
took
his
eyes
from
cosette
all
at
once
the
thenardier
exclaimed
by
the
way
where
s
that
bread
cosette
according
to
her
custom
whenever
the
thenardier
uplifted
her
voice
emerged
with
great
haste
from
beneath
the
table
she
had
completely
forgotten
the
bread
she
had
recourse
to
the
expedient
of
children
who
live
in
a
constant
state
of
fear
she
lied
madame
the
baker
s
shop
was
shut
you
should
have
knocked
i
did
knock
madame
well
he
did
not
open
the
door
i
ll
find
out
to
morrow
whether
that
is
true
said
the
thenardier
and
if
you
are
telling
me
a
lie
i
ll
lead
you
a
pretty
dance
in
the
meantime
give
me
back
my
fifteen
sou
piece
cosette
plunged
her
hand
into
the
pocket
of
her
apron
and
turned
green
the
fifteen
sou
piece
was
not
there
ah
come
now
said
madame
thenardier
did
you
hear
me
cosette
turned
her
pocket
inside
out
there
was
nothing
in
it
what
could
have
become
of
that
money
the
unhappy
little
creature
could
not
find
a
word
to
say
she
was
petrified
have
you
lost
that
fifteen
sou
piece
screamed
the
thenardier
hoarsely
or
do
you
want
to
rob
me
of
it
at
the
same
time
she
stretched
out
her
arm
towards
the
cat
o
nine
tails
which
hung
on
a
nail
in
the
chimney
corner
this
formidable
gesture
restored
to
cosette
sufficient
strength
to
shriek
mercy
madame
madame
i
will
not
do
so
any
more
the
thenardier
took
down
the
whip
in
the
meantime
the
man
in
the
yellow
coat
had
been
fumbling
in
the
fob
of
his
waistcoat
without
any
one
having
noticed
his
movements
besides
the
other
travellers
were
drinking
or
playing
cards
and
were
not
paying
attention
to
anything
cosette
contracted
herself
into
a
ball
with
anguish
within
the
angle
of
the
chimney
endeavoring
to
gather
up
and
conceal
her
poor
half
nude
limbs
the
thenardier
raised
her
arm
pardon
me
madame
said
the
man
but
just
now
i
caught
sight
of
something
which
had
fallen
from
this
little
one
s
apron
pocket
and
rolled
aside
perhaps
this
is
it
at
the
same
time
he
bent
down
and
seemed
to
be
searching
on
the
floor
for
a
moment
exactly
here
it
is
he
went
on
straightening
himself
up
and
he
held
out
a
silver
coin
to
the
thenardier
yes
that
s
it
said
she
it
was
not
it
for
it
was
a
twenty
sou
piece
but
the
thenardier
found
it
to
her
advantage
she
put
the
coin
in
her
pocket
and
confined
herself
to
casting
a
fierce
glance
at
the
child
accompanied
with
the
remark
don
t
let
this
ever
happen
again
cosette
returned
to
what
the
thenardier
called
her
kennel
and
her
large
eyes
which
were
riveted
on
the
traveller
began
to
take
on
an
expression
such
as
they
had
never
worn
before
thus
far
it
was
only
an
innocent
amazement
but
a
sort
of
stupefied
confidence
was
mingled
with
it
by
the
way
would
you
like
some
supper
the
thenardier
inquired
of
the
traveller
he
made
no
reply
he
appeared
to
be
absorbed
in
thought
what
sort
of
a
man
is
that
she
muttered
between
her
teeth
he
s
some
frightfully
poor
wretch
he
hasn
t
a
sou
to
pay
for
a
supper
will
he
even
pay
me
for
his
lodging
it
s
very
lucky
all
the
same
that
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
steal
the
money
that
was
on
the
floor
in
the
meantime
a
door
had
opened
and
eponine
and
azelma
entered
they
were
two
really
pretty
little
girls
more
bourgeois
than
peasant
in
looks
and
very
charming
the
one
with
shining
chestnut
tresses
the
other
with
long
black
braids
hanging
down
her
back
both
vivacious
neat
plump
rosy
and
healthy
and
a
delight
to
the
eye
they
were
warmly
clad
but
with
so
much
maternal
art
that
the
thickness
of
the
stuffs
did
not
detract
from
the
coquetry
of
arrangement
there
was
a
hint
of
winter
though
the
springtime
was
not
wholly
effaced
light
emanated
from
these
two
little
beings
besides
this
they
were
on
the
throne
in
their
toilettes
in
their
gayety
in
the
noise
which
they
made
there
was
sovereignty
when
they
entered
the
thenardier
said
to
them
in
a
grumbling
tone
which
was
full
of
adoration
ah
there
you
are
you
children
then
drawing
them
one
after
the
other
to
her
knees
smoothing
their
hair
tying
their
ribbons
afresh
and
then
releasing
them
with
that
gentle
manner
of
shaking
off
which
is
peculiar
to
mothers
she
exclaimed
what
frights
they
are
they
went
and
seated
themselves
in
the
chimney
corner
they
had
a
doll
which
they
turned
over
and
over
on
their
knees
with
all
sorts
of
joyous
chatter
from
time
to
time
cosette
raised
her
eyes
from
her
knitting
and
watched
their
play
with
a
melancholy
air
eponine
and
azelma
did
not
look
at
cosette
she
was
the
same
as
a
dog
to
them
these
three
little
girls
did
not
yet
reckon
up
four
and
twenty
years
between
them
but
they
already
represented
the
whole
society
of
man
envy
on
the
one
side
disdain
on
the
other
the
doll
of
the
thenardier
sisters
was
very
much
faded
very
old
and
much
broken
but
it
seemed
none
the
less
admirable
to
cosette
who
had
never
had
a
doll
in
her
life
a
real
doll
to
make
use
of
the
expression
which
all
children
will
understand
all
at
once
the
thenardier
who
had
been
going
back
and
forth
in
the
room
perceived
that
cosette
s
mind
was
distracted
and
that
instead
of
working
she
was
paying
attention
to
the
little
ones
at
their
play
ah
i
ve
caught
you
at
it
she
cried
so
that
s
the
way
you
work
i
ll
make
you
work
to
the
tune
of
the
whip
that
i
will
the
stranger
turned
to
the
thenardier
without
quitting
his
chair
bah
madame
he
said
with
an
almost
timid
air
let
her
play
such
a
wish
expressed
by
a
traveller
who
had
eaten
a
slice
of
mutton
and
had
drunk
a
couple
of
bottles
of
wine
with
his
supper
and
who
had
not
the
air
of
being
frightfully
poor
would
have
been
equivalent
to
an
order
but
that
a
man
with
such
a
hat
should
permit
himself
such
a
desire
and
that
a
man
with
such
a
coat
should
permit
himself
to
have
a
will
was
something
which
madame
thenardier
did
not
intend
to
tolerate
she
retorted
with
acrimony
she
must
work
since
she
eats
i
don
t
feed
her
to
do
nothing
what
is
she
making
went
on
the
stranger
in
a
gentle
voice
which
contrasted
strangely
with
his
beggarly
garments
and
his
porter
s
shoulders
the
thenardier
deigned
to
reply
stockings
if
you
please
stockings
for
my
little
girls
who
have
none
so
to
speak
and
who
are
absolutely
barefoot
just
now
the
man
looked
at
cosette
s
poor
little
red
feet
and
continued
when
will
she
have
finished
this
pair
of
stockings
she
has
at
least
three
or
four
good
days
work
on
them
still
the
lazy
creature
and
how
much
will
that
pair
of
stockings
be
worth
when
she
has
finished
them
the
thenardier
cast
a
glance
of
disdain
on
him
thirty
sous
at
least
will
you
sell
them
for
five
francs
went
on
the
man
good
heavens
exclaimed
a
carter
who
was
listening
with
a
loud
laugh
five
francs
the
deuce
i
should
think
so
five
balls
thenardier
thought
it
time
to
strike
in
yes
sir
if
such
is
your
fancy
you
will
be
allowed
to
have
that
pair
of
stockings
for
five
francs
we
can
refuse
nothing
to
travellers
you
must
pay
on
the
spot
said
the
thenardier
in
her
curt
and
peremptory
fashion
i
will
buy
that
pair
of
stockings
replied
the
man
and
he
added
drawing
a
five
franc
piece
from
his
pocket
and
laying
it
on
the
table
i
will
pay
for
them
then
he
turned
to
cosette
now
i
own
your
work
play
my
child
the
carter
was
so
much
touched
by
the
five
franc
piece
that
he
abandoned
his
glass
and
hastened
up
but
it
s
true
he
cried
examining
it
a
real
hind
wheel
and
not
counterfeit
thenardier
approached
and
silently
put
the
coin
in
his
pocket
the
thenardier
had
no
reply
to
make
she
bit
her
lips
and
her
face
assumed
an
expression
of
hatred
in
the
meantime
cosette
was
trembling
she
ventured
to
ask
is
it
true
madame
may
i
play
play
said
the
thenardier
in
a
terrible
voice
thanks
madame
said
cosette
and
while
her
mouth
thanked
the
thenardier
her
whole
little
soul
thanked
the
traveller
thenardier
had
resumed
his
drinking
his
wife
whispered
in
his
ear
who
can
this
yellow
man
be
i
have
seen
millionaires
with
coats
like
that
replied
thenardier
in
a
sovereign
manner
cosette
had
dropped
her
knitting
but
had
not
left
her
seat
cosette
always
moved
as
little
as
possible
she
picked
up
some
old
rags
and
her
little
lead
sword
from
a
box
behind
her
eponine
and
azelma
paid
no
attention
to
what
was
going
on
they
had
just
executed
a
very
important
operation
they
had
just
got
hold
of
the
cat
they
had
thrown
their
doll
on
the
ground
and
eponine
who
was
the
elder
was
swathing
the
little
cat
in
spite
of
its
mewing
and
its
contortions
in
a
quantity
of
clothes
and
red
and
blue
scraps
while
performing
this
serious
and
difficult
work
she
was
saying
to
her
sister
in
that
sweet
and
adorable
language
of
children
whose
grace
like
the
splendor
of
the
butterfly
s
wing
vanishes
when
one
essays
to
fix
it
fast
you
see
sister
this
doll
is
more
amusing
than
the
other
she
twists
she
cries
she
is
warm
see
sister
let
us
play
with
her
she
shall
be
my
little
girl
i
will
be
a
lady
i
will
come
to
see
you
and
you
shall
look
at
her
gradually
you
will
perceive
her
whiskers
and
that
will
surprise
you
and
then
you
will
see
her
ears
and
then
you
will
see
her
tail
and
it
will
amaze
you
and
you
will
say
to
me
ah
mon
dieu
and
i
will
say
to
you
yes
madame
it
is
my
little
girl
little
girls
are
made
like
that
just
at
present
azelma
listened
admiringly
to
eponine
in
the
meantime
the
drinkers
had
begun
to
sing
an
obscene
song
and
to
laugh
at
it
until
the
ceiling
shook
thenardier
accompanied
and
encouraged
them
as
birds
make
nests
out
of
everything
so
children
make
a
doll
out
of
anything
which
comes
to
hand
while
eponine
and
azelma
were
bundling
up
the
cat
cosette
on
her
side
had
dressed
up
her
sword
that
done
she
laid
it
in
her
arms
and
sang
to
it
softly
to
lull
it
to
sleep
the
doll
is
one
of
the
most
imperious
needs
and
at
the
same
time
one
of
the
most
charming
instincts
of
feminine
childhood
to
care
for
to
clothe
to
deck
to
dress
to
undress
to
redress
to
teach
scold
a
little
to
rock
to
dandle
to
lull
to
sleep
to
imagine
that
something
is
some
one
therein
lies
the
whole
woman
s
future
while
dreaming
and
chattering
making
tiny
outfits
and
baby
clothes
while
sewing
little
gowns
and
corsages
and
bodices
the
child
grows
into
a
young
girl
the
young
girl
into
a
big
girl
the
big
girl
into
a
woman
the
first
child
is
the
continuation
of
the
last
doll
a
little
girl
without
a
doll
is
almost
as
unhappy
and
quite
as
impossible
as
a
woman
without
children
so
cosette
had
made
herself
a
doll
out
of
the
sword
madame
thenardier
approached
the
yellow
man
my
husband
is
right
she
thought
perhaps
it
is
m
laffitte
there
are
such
queer
rich
men
she
came
and
set
her
elbows
on
the
table
monsieur
said
she
at
this
word
monsieur
the
man
turned
up
to
that
time
the
thenardier
had
addressed
him
only
as
brave
homme
or
bonhomme
you
see
sir
she
pursued
assuming
a
sweetish
air
that
was
even
more
repulsive
to
behold
than
her
fierce
mien
i
am
willing
that
the
child
should
play
i
do
not
oppose
it
but
it
is
good
for
once
because
you
are
generous
you
see
she
has
nothing
she
must
needs
work
then
this
child
is
not
yours
demanded
the
man
oh
mon
dieu
no
sir
she
is
a
little
beggar
whom
we
have
taken
in
through
charity
a
sort
of
imbecile
child
she
must
have
water
on
the
brain
she
has
a
large
head
as
you
see
we
do
what
we
can
for
her
for
we
are
not
rich
we
have
written
in
vain
to
her
native
place
and
have
received
no
reply
these
six
months
it
must
be
that
her
mother
is
dead
ah
said
the
man
and
fell
into
his
revery
once
more
her
mother
didn
t
amount
to
much
added
the
thenardier
she
abandoned
her
child
during
the
whole
of
this
conversation
cosette
as
though
warned
by
some
instinct
that
she
was
under
discussion
had
not
taken
her
eyes
from
the
thenardier
s
face
she
listened
vaguely
she
caught
a
few
words
here
and
there
meanwhile
the
drinkers
all
three
quarters
intoxicated
were
repeating
their
unclean
refrain
with
redoubled
gayety
it
was
a
highly
spiced
and
wanton
song
in
which
the
virgin
and
the
infant
jesus
were
introduced
the
thenardier
went
off
to
take
part
in
the
shouts
of
laughter
cosette
from
her
post
under
the
table
gazed
at
the
fire
which
was
reflected
from
her
fixed
eyes
she
had
begun
to
rock
the
sort
of
baby
which
she
had
made
and
as
she
rocked
it
she
sang
in
a
low
voice
my
mother
is
dead
my
mother
is
dead
my
mother
is
dead
on
being
urged
afresh
by
the
hostess
the
yellow
man
the
millionaire
consented
at
last
to
take
supper
what
does
monsieur
wish
bread
and
cheese
said
the
man
decidedly
he
is
a
beggar
thought
madame
thenardier
the
drunken
men
were
still
singing
their
song
and
the
child
under
the
table
was
singing
hers
all
at
once
cosette
paused
she
had
just
turned
round
and
caught
sight
of
the
little
thenardiers
doll
which
they
had
abandoned
for
the
cat
and
had
left
on
the
floor
a
few
paces
from
the
kitchen
table
then
she
dropped
the
swaddled
sword
which
only
half
met
her
needs
and
cast
her
eyes
slowly
round
the
room
madame
thenardier
was
whispering
to
her
husband
and
counting
over
some
money
ponine
and
zelma
were
playing
with
the
cat
the
travellers
were
eating
or
drinking
or
singing
not
a
glance
was
fixed
on
her
she
had
not
a
moment
to
lose
she
crept
out
from
under
the
table
on
her
hands
and
knees
made
sure
once
more
that
no
one
was
watching
her
then
she
slipped
quickly
up
to
the
doll
and
seized
it
an
instant
later
she
was
in
her
place
again
seated
motionless
and
only
turned
so
as
to
cast
a
shadow
on
the
doll
which
she
held
in
her
arms
the
happiness
of
playing
with
a
doll
was
so
rare
for
her
that
it
contained
all
the
violence
of
voluptuousness
no
one
had
seen
her
except
the
traveller
who
was
slowly
devouring
his
meagre
supper
this
joy
lasted
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
but
with
all
the
precautions
that
cosette
had
taken
she
did
not
perceive
that
one
of
the
doll
s
legs
stuck
out
and
that
the
fire
on
the
hearth
lighted
it
up
very
vividly
that
pink
and
shining
foot
projecting
from
the
shadow
suddenly
struck
the
eye
of
azelma
who
said
to
eponine
look
sister
the
two
little
girls
paused
in
stupefaction
cosette
had
dared
to
take
their
doll
eponine
rose
and
without
releasing
the
cat
she
ran
to
her
mother
and
began
to
tug
at
her
skirt
let
me
alone
said
her
mother
what
do
you
want
mother
said
the
child
look
there
and
she
pointed
to
cosette
cosette
absorbed
in
the
ecstasies
of
possession
no
longer
saw
or
heard
anything
madame
thenardier
s
countenance
assumed
that
peculiar
expression
which
is
composed
of
the
terrible
mingled
with
the
trifles
of
life
and
which
has
caused
this
style
of
woman
to
be
named
megaeras
on
this
occasion
wounded
pride
exasperated
her
wrath
still
further
cosette
had
overstepped
all
bounds
cosette
had
laid
violent
hands
on
the
doll
belonging
to
these
young
ladies
a
czarina
who
should
see
a
muzhik
trying
on
her
imperial
son
s
blue
ribbon
would
wear
no
other
face
she
shrieked
in
a
voice
rendered
hoarse
with
indignation
cosette
cosette
started
as
though
the
earth
had
trembled
beneath
her
she
turned
round
cosette
repeated
the
thenardier
cosette
took
the
doll
and
laid
it
gently
on
the
floor
with
a
sort
of
veneration
mingled
with
despair
then
without
taking
her
eyes
from
it
she
clasped
her
hands
and
what
is
terrible
to
relate
of
a
child
of
that
age
she
wrung
them
then
not
one
of
the
emotions
of
the
day
neither
the
trip
to
the
forest
nor
the
weight
of
the
bucket
of
water
nor
the
loss
of
the
money
nor
the
sight
of
the
whip
nor
even
the
sad
words
which
she
had
heard
madame
thenardier
utter
had
been
able
to
wring
this
from
her
she
wept
she
burst
out
sobbing
meanwhile
the
traveller
had
risen
to
his
feet
what
is
the
matter
he
said
to
the
thenardier
don
t
you
see
said
the
thenardier
pointing
to
the
corpus
delicti
which
lay
at
cosette
s
feet
well
what
of
it
resumed
the
man
that
beggar
replied
the
thenardier
has
permitted
herself
to
touch
the
children
s
doll
all
this
noise
for
that
said
the
man
well
what
if
she
did
play
with
that
doll
she
touched
it
with
her
dirty
hands
pursued
the
thenardier
with
her
frightful
hands
here
cosette
redoubled
her
sobs
will
you
stop
your
noise
screamed
the
thenardier
the
man
went
straight
to
the
street
door
opened
it
and
stepped
out
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
the
thenardier
profited
by
his
absence
to
give
cosette
a
hearty
kick
under
the
table
which
made
the
child
utter
loud
cries
the
door
opened
again
the
man
re
appeared
he
carried
in
both
hands
the
fabulous
doll
which
we
have
mentioned
and
which
all
the
village
brats
had
been
staring
at
ever
since
the
morning
and
he
set
it
upright
in
front
of
cosette
saying
here
this
is
for
you
it
must
be
supposed
that
in
the
course
of
the
hour
and
more
which
he
had
spent
there
he
had
taken
confused
notice
through
his
revery
of
that
toy
shop
lighted
up
by
fire
pots
and
candles
so
splendidly
that
it
was
visible
like
an
illumination
through
the
window
of
the
drinking
shop
cosette
raised
her
eyes
she
gazed
at
the
man
approaching
her
with
that
doll
as
she
might
have
gazed
at
the
sun
she
heard
the
unprecedented
words
it
is
for
you
she
stared
at
him
she
stared
at
the
doll
then
she
slowly
retreated
and
hid
herself
at
the
extreme
end
under
the
table
in
a
corner
of
the
wall
she
no
longer
cried
she
no
longer
wept
she
had
the
appearance
of
no
longer
daring
to
breathe
the
thenardier
eponine
and
azelma
were
like
statues
also
the
very
drinkers
had
paused
a
solemn
silence
reigned
through
the
whole
room
madame
thenardier
petrified
and
mute
recommenced
her
conjectures
who
is
that
old
fellow
is
he
a
poor
man
is
he
a
millionaire
perhaps
he
is
both
that
is
to
say
a
thief
the
face
of
the
male
thenardier
presented
that
expressive
fold
which
accentuates
the
human
countenance
whenever
the
dominant
instinct
appears
there
in
all
its
bestial
force
the
tavern
keeper
stared
alternately
at
the
doll
and
at
the
traveller
he
seemed
to
be
scenting
out
the
man
as
he
would
have
scented
out
a
bag
of
money
this
did
not
last
longer
than
the
space
of
a
flash
of
lightning
he
stepped
up
to
his
wife
and
said
to
her
in
a
low
voice
that
machine
costs
at
least
thirty
francs
no
nonsense
down
on
your
belly
before
that
man
gross
natures
have
this
in
common
with
naive
natures
that
they
possess
no
transition
state
well
cosette
said
the
thenardier
in
a
voice
that
strove
to
be
sweet
and
which
was
composed
of
the
bitter
honey
of
malicious
women
aren
t
you
going
to
take
your
doll
cosette
ventured
to
emerge
from
her
hole
the
gentleman
has
given
you
a
doll
my
little
cosette
said
thenardier
with
a
caressing
air
take
it
it
is
yours
cosette
gazed
at
the
marvellous
doll
in
a
sort
of
terror
her
face
was
still
flooded
with
tears
but
her
eyes
began
to
fill
like
the
sky
at
daybreak
with
strange
beams
of
joy
what
she
felt
at
that
moment
was
a
little
like
what
she
would
have
felt
if
she
had
been
abruptly
told
little
one
you
are
the
queen
of
france
it
seemed
to
her
that
if
she
touched
that
doll
lightning
would
dart
from
it
this
was
true
up
to
a
certain
point
for
she
said
to
herself
that
the
thenardier
would
scold
and
beat
her
nevertheless
the
attraction
carried
the
day
she
ended
by
drawing
near
and
murmuring
timidly
as
she
turned
towards
madame
thenardier
may
i
madame
no
words
can
render
that
air
at
once
despairing
terrified
and
ecstatic
pardi
cried
the
thenardier
it
is
yours
the
gentleman
has
given
it
to
you
truly
sir
said
cosette
is
it
true
is
the
lady
mine
the
stranger
s
eyes
seemed
to
be
full
of
tears
he
appeared
to
have
reached
that
point
of
emotion
where
a
man
does
not
speak
for
fear
lest
he
should
weep
he
nodded
to
cosette
and
placed
the
lady
s
hand
in
her
tiny
hand
cosette
hastily
withdrew
her
hand
as
though
that
of
the
lady
scorched
her
and
began
to
stare
at
the
floor
we
are
forced
to
add
that
at
that
moment
she
stuck
out
her
tongue
immoderately
all
at
once
she
wheeled
round
and
seized
the
doll
in
a
transport
i
shall
call
her
catherine
she
said
it
was
an
odd
moment
when
cosette
s
rags
met
and
clasped
the
ribbons
and
fresh
pink
muslins
of
the
doll
madame
she
resumed
may
i
put
her
on
a
chair
yes
my
child
replied
the
thenardier
it
was
now
the
turn
of
eponine
and
azelma
to
gaze
at
cosette
with
envy
cosette
placed
catherine
on
a
chair
then
seated
herself
on
the
floor
in
front
of
her
and
remained
motionless
without
uttering
a
word
in
an
attitude
of
contemplation
play
cosette
said
the
stranger
oh
i
am
playing
returned
the
child
this
stranger
this
unknown
individual
who
had
the
air
of
a
visit
which
providence
was
making
on
cosette
was
the
person
whom
the
thenardier
hated
worse
than
any
one
in
the
world
at
that
moment
however
it
was
necessary
to
control
herself
habituated
as
she
was
to
dissimulation
through
endeavoring
to
copy
her
husband
in
all
his
actions
these
emotions
were
more
than
she
could
endure
she
made
haste
to
send
her
daughters
to
bed
then
she
asked
the
man
s
permission
to
send
cosette
off
also
for
she
has
worked
hard
all
day
she
added
with
a
maternal
air
cosette
went
off
to
bed
carrying
catherine
in
her
arms
from
time
to
time
the
thenardier
went
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
where
her
husband
was
to
relieve
her
soul
as
she
said
she
exchanged
with
her
husband
words
which
were
all
the
more
furious
because
she
dared
not
utter
them
aloud
old
beast
what
has
he
got
in
his
belly
to
come
and
upset
us
in
this
manner
to
want
that
little
monster
to
play
to
give
away
forty
franc
dolls
to
a
jade
that
i
would
sell
for
forty
sous
so
i
would
a
little
more
and
he
will
be
saying
your
majesty
to
her
as
though
to
the
duchess
de
berry
is
there
any
sense
in
it
is
he
mad
then
that
mysterious
old
fellow
why
it
is
perfectly
simple
replied
thenardier
if
that
amuses
him
it
amuses
you
to
have
the
little
one
work
it
amuses
him
to
have
her
play
he
s
all
right
a
traveller
can
do
what
he
pleases
when
he
pays
for
it
if
the
old
fellow
is
a
philanthropist
what
is
that
to
you
if
he
is
an
imbecile
it
does
not
concern
you
what
are
you
worrying
for
so
long
as
he
has
money
the
language
of
a
master
and
the
reasoning
of
an
innkeeper
neither
of
which
admitted
of
any
reply
the
man
had
placed
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
resumed
his
thoughtful
attitude
all
the
other
travellers
both
pedlers
and
carters
had
withdrawn
a
little
and
had
ceased
singing
they
were
staring
at
him
from
a
distance
with
a
sort
of
respectful
awe
this
poorly
dressed
man
who
drew
hind
wheels
from
his
pocket
with
so
much
ease
and
who
lavished
gigantic
dolls
on
dirty
little
brats
in
wooden
shoes
was
certainly
a
magnificent
fellow
and
one
to
be
feared
many
hours
passed
the
midnight
mass
was
over
the
chimes
had
ceased
the
drinkers
had
taken
their
departure
the
drinking
shop
was
closed
the
public
room
was
deserted
the
fire
extinct
the
stranger
still
remained
in
the
same
place
and
the
same
attitude
from
time
to
time
he
changed
the
elbow
on
which
he
leaned
that
was
all
but
he
had
not
said
a
word
since
cosette
had
left
the
room
the
thenardiers
alone
out
of
politeness
and
curiosity
had
remained
in
the
room
is
he
going
to
pass
the
night
in
that
fashion
grumbled
the
thenardier
when
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
struck
she
declared
herself
vanquished
and
said
to
her
husband
i
m
going
to
bed
do
as
you
like
her
husband
seated
himself
at
a
table
in
the
corner
lighted
a
candle
and
began
to
read
the
courrier
francais
a
good
hour
passed
thus
the
worthy
inn
keeper
had
perused
the
courrier
francais
at
least
three
times
from
the
date
of
the
number
to
the
printer
s
name
the
stranger
did
not
stir
thenardier
fidgeted
coughed
spit
blew
his
nose
and
creaked
his
chair
not
a
movement
on
the
man
s
part
is
he
asleep
thought
thenardier
the
man
was
not
asleep
but
nothing
could
arouse
him
at
last
thenardier
took
off
his
cap
stepped
gently
up
to
him
and
ventured
to
say
is
not
monsieur
going
to
his
repose
not
going
to
bed
would
have
seemed
to
him
excessive
and
familiar
to
repose
smacked
of
luxury
and
respect
these
words
possess
the
mysterious
and
admirable
property
of
swelling
the
bill
on
the
following
day
a
chamber
where
one
sleeps
costs
twenty
sous
a
chamber
in
which
one
reposes
costs
twenty
francs
well
said
the
stranger
you
are
right
where
is
your
stable
sir
exclaimed
thenardier
with
a
smile
i
will
conduct
you
sir
he
took
the
candle
the
man
picked
up
his
bundle
and
cudgel
and
thenardier
conducted
him
to
a
chamber
on
the
first
floor
which
was
of
rare
splendor
all
furnished
in
mahogany
with
a
low
bedstead
curtained
with
red
calico
what
is
this
said
the
traveller
it
is
really
our
bridal
chamber
said
the
tavern
keeper
my
wife
and
i
occupy
another
this
is
only
entered
three
or
four
times
a
year
i
should
have
liked
the
stable
quite
as
well
said
the
man
abruptly
thenardier
pretended
not
to
hear
this
unamiable
remark
he
lighted
two
perfectly
fresh
wax
candles
which
figured
on
the
chimney
piece
a
very
good
fire
was
flickering
on
the
hearth
on
the
chimney
piece
under
a
glass
globe
stood
a
woman
s
head
dress
in
silver
wire
and
orange
flowers
and
what
is
this
resumed
the
stranger
that
sir
said
thenardier
is
my
wife
s
wedding
bonnet
the
traveller
surveyed
the
object
with
a
glance
which
seemed
to
say
there
really
was
a
time
then
when
that
monster
was
a
maiden
thenardier
lied
however
when
he
had
leased
this
paltry
building
for
the
purpose
of
converting
it
into
a
tavern
he
had
found
this
chamber
decorated
in
just
this
manner
and
had
purchased
the
furniture
and
obtained
the
orange
flowers
at
second
hand
with
the
idea
that
this
would
cast
a
graceful
shadow
on
his
spouse
and
would
result
in
what
the
english
call
respectability
for
his
house
when
the
traveller
turned
round
the
host
had
disappeared
thenardier
had
withdrawn
discreetly
without
venturing
to
wish
him
a
good
night
as
he
did
not
wish
to
treat
with
disrespectful
cordiality
a
man
whom
he
proposed
to
fleece
royally
the
following
morning
the
inn
keeper
retired
to
his
room
his
wife
was
in
bed
but
she
was
not
asleep
when
she
heard
her
husband
s
step
she
turned
over
and
said
to
him
do
you
know
i
m
going
to
turn
cosette
out
of
doors
to
morrow
thenardier
replied
coldly
how
you
do
go
on
they
exchanged
no
further
words
and
a
few
moments
later
their
candle
was
extinguished
as
for
the
traveller
he
had
deposited
his
cudgel
and
his
bundle
in
a
corner
the
landlord
once
gone
he
threw
himself
into
an
arm
chair
and
remained
for
some
time
buried
in
thought
then
he
removed
his
shoes
took
one
of
the
two
candles
blew
out
the
other
opened
the
door
and
quitted
the
room
gazing
about
him
like
a
person
who
is
in
search
of
something
he
traversed
a
corridor
and
came
upon
a
staircase
there
he
heard
a
very
faint
and
gentle
sound
like
the
breathing
of
a
child
he
followed
this
sound
and
came
to
a
sort
of
triangular
recess
built
under
the
staircase
or
rather
formed
by
the
staircase
itself
this
recess
was
nothing
else
than
the
space
under
the
steps
there
in
the
midst
of
all
sorts
of
old
papers
and
potsherds
among
dust
and
spiders
webs
was
a
bed
if
one
can
call
by
the
name
of
bed
a
straw
pallet
so
full
of
holes
as
to
display
the
straw
and
a
coverlet
so
tattered
as
to
show
the
pallet
no
sheets
this
was
placed
on
the
floor
in
this
bed
cosette
was
sleeping
the
man
approached
and
gazed
down
upon
her
cosette
was
in
a
profound
sleep
she
was
fully
dressed
in
the
winter
she
did
not
undress
in
order
that
she
might
not
be
so
cold
against
her
breast
was
pressed
the
doll
whose
large
eyes
wide
open
glittered
in
the
dark
from
time
to
time
she
gave
vent
to
a
deep
sigh
as
though
she
were
on
the
point
of
waking
and
she
strained
the
doll
almost
convulsively
in
her
arms
beside
her
bed
there
was
only
one
of
her
wooden
shoes
a
door
which
stood
open
near
cosette
s
pallet
permitted
a
view
of
a
rather
large
dark
room
the
stranger
stepped
into
it
at
the
further
extremity
through
a
glass
door
he
saw
two
small
very
white
beds
they
belonged
to
eponine
and
azelma
behind
these
beds
and
half
hidden
stood
an
uncurtained
wicker
cradle
in
which
the
little
boy
who
had
cried
all
the
evening
lay
asleep
the
stranger
conjectured
that
this
chamber
connected
with
that
of
the
thenardier
pair
he
was
on
the
point
of
retreating
when
his
eye
fell
upon
the
fireplace
one
of
those
vast
tavern
chimneys
where
there
is
always
so
little
fire
when
there
is
any
fire
at
all
and
which
are
so
cold
to
look
at
there
was
no
fire
in
this
one
there
was
not
even
ashes
but
there
was
something
which
attracted
the
stranger
s
gaze
nevertheless
it
was
two
tiny
children
s
shoes
coquettish
in
shape
and
unequal
in
size
the
traveller
recalled
the
graceful
and
immemorial
custom
in
accordance
with
which
children
place
their
shoes
in
the
chimney
on
christmas
eve
there
to
await
in
the
darkness
some
sparkling
gift
from
their
good
fairy
eponine
and
azelma
had
taken
care
not
to
omit
this
and
each
of
them
had
set
one
of
her
shoes
on
the
hearth
the
traveller
bent
over
them
the
fairy
that
is
to
say
their
mother
had
already
paid
her
visit
and
in
each
he
saw
a
brand
new
and
shining
ten
sou
piece
the
man
straightened
himself
up
and
was
on
the
point
of
withdrawing
when
far
in
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
hearth
he
caught
sight
of
another
object
he
looked
at
it
and
recognized
a
wooden
shoe
a
frightful
shoe
of
the
coarsest
description
half
dilapidated
and
all
covered
with
ashes
and
dried
mud
it
was
cosette
s
sabot
cosette
with
that
touching
trust
of
childhood
which
can
always
be
deceived
yet
never
discouraged
had
placed
her
shoe
on
the
hearth
stone
also
hope
in
a
child
who
has
never
known
anything
but
despair
is
a
sweet
and
touching
thing
there
was
nothing
in
this
wooden
shoe
the
stranger
fumbled
in
his
waistcoat
bent
over
and
placed
a
louis
d
or
in
cosette
s
shoe
then
he
regained
his
own
chamber
with
the
stealthy
tread
of
a
wolf
chapter
ix
thenardier
and
his
manoeuvres
on
the
following
morning
two
hours
at
least
before
day
break
thenardier
seated
beside
a
candle
in
the
public
room
of
the
tavern
pen
in
hand
was
making
out
the
bill
for
the
traveller
with
the
yellow
coat
his
wife
standing
beside
him
and
half
bent
over
him
was
following
him
with
her
eyes
they
exchanged
not
a
word
on
the
one
hand
there
was
profound
meditation
on
the
other
the
religious
admiration
with
which
one
watches
the
birth
and
development
of
a
marvel
of
the
human
mind
a
noise
was
audible
in
the
house
it
was
the
lark
sweeping
the
stairs
after
the
lapse
of
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
and
some
erasures
thenardier
produced
the
following
masterpiece
bill
of
the
gentleman
in
no
1
supper
3
francs
chamber
10
candle
5
fire
4

1
total
23
francs
service
was
written
servisse
twenty
three
francs
cried
the
woman
with
an
enthusiasm
which
was
mingled
with
some
hesitation
like
all
great
artists
thenardier
was
dissatisfied
peuh
he
exclaimed
it
was
the
accent
of
castlereagh
auditing
france
s
bill
at
the
congress
of
vienna
monsieur
thenardier
you
are
right
he
certainly
owes
that
murmured
the
wife
who
was
thinking
of
the
doll
bestowed
on
cosette
in
the
presence
of
her
daughters
it
is
just
but
it
is
too
much
he
will
not
pay
it
thenardier
laughed
coldly
as
usual
and
said
he
will
pay
this
laugh
was
the
supreme
assertion
of
certainty
and
authority
that
which
was
asserted
in
this
manner
must
needs
be
so
his
wife
did
not
insist
she
set
about
arranging
the
table
her
husband
paced
the
room
a
moment
later
he
added
i
owe
full
fifteen
hundred
francs
he
went
and
seated
himself
in
the
chimney
corner
meditating
with
his
feet
among
the
warm
ashes
ah
by
the
way
resumed
his
wife
you
don
t
forget
that
i
m
going
to
turn
cosette
out
of
doors
to
day
the
monster
she
breaks
my
heart
with
that
doll
of
hers
i
d
rather
marry
louis
xviii
than
keep
her
another
day
in
the
house
thenardier
lighted
his
pipe
and
replied
between
two
puffs
you
will
hand
that
bill
to
the
man
then
he
went
out
hardly
had
he
left
the
room
when
the
traveller
entered
thenardier
instantly
reappeared
behind
him
and
remained
motionless
in
the
half
open
door
visible
only
to
his
wife
the
yellow
man
carried
his
bundle
and
his
cudgel
in
his
hand
up
so
early
said
madame
thenardier
is
monsieur
leaving
us
already
as
she
spoke
thus
she
was
twisting
the
bill
about
in
her
hands
with
an
embarrassed
air
and
making
creases
in
it
with
her
nails
her
hard
face
presented
a
shade
which
was
not
habitual
with
it
timidity
and
scruples
to
present
such
a
bill
to
a
man
who
had
so
completely
the
air
of
a
poor
wretch
seemed
difficult
to
her
the
traveller
appeared
to
be
preoccupied
and
absent
minded
he
replied
yes
madame
i
am
going
so
monsieur
has
no
business
in
montfermeil
no
i
was
passing
through
that
is
all
what
do
i
owe
you
madame
he
added
the
thenardier
silently
handed
him
the
folded
bill
the
man
unfolded
the
paper
and
glanced
at
it
but
his
thoughts
were
evidently
elsewhere
madame
he
resumed
is
business
good
here
in
montfermeil
so
so
monsieur
replied
the
thenardier
stupefied
at
not
witnessing
another
sort
of
explosion
she
continued
in
a
dreary
and
lamentable
tone
oh
monsieur
times
are
so
hard
and
then
we
have
so
few
bourgeois
in
the
neighborhood
all
the
people
are
poor
you
see
if
we
had
not
now
and
then
some
rich
and
generous
travellers
like
monsieur
we
should
not
get
along
at
all
we
have
so
many
expenses
just
see
that
child
is
costing
us
our
very
eyes
what
child
why
the
little
one
you
know
cosette
the
lark
as
she
is
called
hereabouts
ah
said
the
man
she
went
on
how
stupid
these
peasants
are
with
their
nicknames
she
has
more
the
air
of
a
bat
than
of
a
lark
you
see
sir
we
do
not
ask
charity
and
we
cannot
bestow
it
we
earn
nothing
and
we
have
to
pay
out
a
great
deal
the
license
the
imposts
the
door
and
window
tax
the
hundredths
monsieur
is
aware
that
the
government
demands
a
terrible
deal
of
money
and
then
i
have
my
daughters
i
have
no
need
to
bring
up
other
people
s
children
the
man
resumed
in
that
voice
which
he
strove
to
render
indifferent
and
in
which
there
lingered
a
tremor
what
if
one
were
to
rid
you
of
her
who
cosette
yes
the
landlady
s
red
and
violent
face
brightened
up
hideously
ah
sir
my
dear
sir
take
her
keep
her
lead
her
off
carry
her
away
sugar
her
stuff
her
with
truffles
drink
her
eat
her
and
the
blessings
of
the
good
holy
virgin
and
of
all
the
saints
of
paradise
be
upon
you
agreed
really
you
will
take
her
away
i
will
take
her
away
immediately
immediately
call
the
child
cosette
screamed
the
thenardier
in
the
meantime
pursued
the
man
i
will
pay
you
what
i
owe
you
how
much
is
it
he
cast
a
glance
on
the
bill
and
could
not
restrain
a
start
of
surprise
twenty
three
francs
he
looked
at
the
landlady
and
repeated
twenty
three
francs
there
was
in
the
enunciation
of
these
words
thus
repeated
an
accent
between
an
exclamation
and
an
interrogation
point
the
thenardier
had
had
time
to
prepare
herself
for
the
shock
she
replied
with
assurance
good
gracious
yes
sir
it
is
twenty
three
francs
the
stranger
laid
five
five
franc
pieces
on
the
table
go
and
get
the
child
said
he
at
that
moment
thenardier
advanced
to
the
middle
of
the
room
and
said
monsieur
owes
twenty
six
sous
twenty
six
sous
exclaimed
his
wife
twenty
sous
for
the
chamber
resumed
thenardier
coldly
and
six
sous
for
his
supper
as
for
the
child
i
must
discuss
that
matter
a
little
with
the
gentleman
leave
us
wife
madame
thenardier
was
dazzled
as
with
the
shock
caused
by
unexpected
lightning
flashes
of
talent
she
was
conscious
that
a
great
actor
was
making
his
entrance
on
the
stage
uttered
not
a
word
in
reply
and
left
the
room
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
thenardier
offered
the
traveller
a
chair
the
traveller
seated
himself
thenardier
remained
standing
and
his
face
assumed
a
singular
expression
of
good
fellowship
and
simplicity
sir
said
he
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
is
this
that
i
adore
that
child
the
stranger
gazed
intently
at
him
what
child
thenardier
continued
how
strange
it
is
one
grows
attached
what
money
is
that
take
back
your
hundred
sou
piece
i
adore
the
child
whom
do
you
mean
demanded
the
stranger
eh
our
little
cosette
are
you
not
intending
to
take
her
away
from
us
well
i
speak
frankly
as
true
as
you
are
an
honest
man
i
will
not
consent
to
it
i
shall
miss
that
child
i
saw
her
first
when
she
was
a
tiny
thing
it
is
true
that
she
costs
us
money
it
is
true
that
she
has
her
faults
it
is
true
that
we
are
not
rich
it
is
true
that
i
have
paid
out
over
four
hundred
francs
for
drugs
for
just
one
of
her
illnesses
but
one
must
do
something
for
the
good
god
s
sake
she
has
neither
father
nor
mother
i
have
brought
her
up
i
have
bread
enough
for
her
and
for
myself
in
truth
i
think
a
great
deal
of
that
child
you
understand
one
conceives
an
affection
for
a
person
i
am
a
good
sort
of
a
beast
i
am
i
do
not
reason
i
love
that
little
girl
my
wife
is
quick
tempered
but
she
loves
her
also
you
see
she
is
just
the
same
as
our
own
child
i
want
to
keep
her
to
babble
about
the
house
the
stranger
kept
his
eye
intently
fixed
on
thenardier
the
latter
continued
excuse
me
sir
but
one
does
not
give
away
one
s
child
to
a
passer
by
like
that
i
am
right
am
i
not
still
i
don
t
say
you
are
rich
you
have
the
air
of
a
very
good
man
if
it
were
for
her
happiness
but
one
must
find
out
that
you
understand
suppose
that
i
were
to
let
her
go
and
to
sacrifice
myself
i
should
like
to
know
what
becomes
of
her
i
should
not
wish
to
lose
sight
of
her
i
should
like
to
know
with
whom
she
is
living
so
that
i
could
go
to
see
her
from
time
to
time
so
that
she
may
know
that
her
good
foster
father
is
alive
that
he
is
watching
over
her
in
short
there
are
things
which
are
not
possible
i
do
not
even
know
your
name
if
you
were
to
take
her
away
i
should
say
well
and
the
lark
what
has
become
of
her
one
must
at
least
see
some
petty
scrap
of
paper
some
trifle
in
the
way
of
a
passport
you
know
the
stranger
still
surveying
him
with
that
gaze
which
penetrates
as
the
saying
goes
to
the
very
depths
of
the
conscience
replied
in
a
grave
firm
voice
monsieur
thenardier
one
does
not
require
a
passport
to
travel
five
leagues
from
paris
if
i
take
cosette
away
i
shall
take
her
away
and
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter
you
will
not
know
my
name
you
will
not
know
my
residence
you
will
not
know
where
she
is
and
my
intention
is
that
she
shall
never
set
eyes
on
you
again
so
long
as
she
lives
i
break
the
thread
which
binds
her
foot
and
she
departs
does
that
suit
you
yes
or
no
since
geniuses
like
demons
recognize
the
presence
of
a
superior
god
by
certain
signs
thenardier
comprehended
that
he
had
to
deal
with
a
very
strong
person
it
was
like
an
intuition
he
comprehended
it
with
his
clear
and
sagacious
promptitude
while
drinking
with
the
carters
smoking
and
singing
coarse
songs
on
the
preceding
evening
he
had
devoted
the
whole
of
the
time
to
observing
the
stranger
watching
him
like
a
cat
and
studying
him
like
a
mathematician
he
had
watched
him
both
on
his
own
account
for
the
pleasure
of
the
thing
and
through
instinct
and
had
spied
upon
him
as
though
he
had
been
paid
for
so
doing
not
a
movement
not
a
gesture
on
the
part
of
the
man
in
the
yellow
great
coat
had
escaped
him
even
before
the
stranger
had
so
clearly
manifested
his
interest
in
cosette
thenardier
had
divined
his
purpose
he
had
caught
the
old
man
s
deep
glances
returning
constantly
to
the
child
who
was
this
man
why
this
interest
why
this
hideous
costume
when
he
had
so
much
money
in
his
purse
questions
which
he
put
to
himself
without
being
able
to
solve
them
and
which
irritated
him
he
had
pondered
it
all
night
long
he
could
not
be
cosette
s
father
was
he
her
grandfather
then
why
not
make
himself
known
at
once
when
one
has
a
right
one
asserts
it
this
man
evidently
had
no
right
over
cosette
what
was
it
then
thenardier
lost
himself
in
conjectures
he
caught
glimpses
of
everything
but
he
saw
nothing
be
that
as
it
may
on
entering
into
conversation
with
the
man
sure
that
there
was
some
secret
in
the
case
that
the
latter
had
some
interest
in
remaining
in
the
shadow
he
felt
himself
strong
when
he
perceived
from
the
stranger
s
clear
and
firm
retort
that
this
mysterious
personage
was
mysterious
in
so
simple
a
way
he
became
conscious
that
he
was
weak
he
had
expected
nothing
of
the
sort
his
conjectures
were
put
to
the
rout
he
rallied
his
ideas
he
weighed
everything
in
the
space
of
a
second
thenardier
was
one
of
those
men
who
take
in
a
situation
at
a
glance
he
decided
that
the
moment
had
arrived
for
proceeding
straightforward
and
quickly
at
that
he
did
as
great
leaders
do
at
the
decisive
moment
which
they
know
that
they
alone
recognize
he
abruptly
unmasked
his
batteries
sir
said
he
i
am
in
need
of
fifteen
hundred
francs
the
stranger
took
from
his
side
pocket
an
old
pocketbook
of
black
leather
opened
it
drew
out
three
bank
bills
which
he
laid
on
the
table
then
he
placed
his
large
thumb
on
the
notes
and
said
to
the
inn
keeper
go
and
fetch
cosette
while
this
was
taking
place
what
had
cosette
been
doing
on
waking
up
cosette
had
run
to
get
her
shoe
in
it
she
had
found
the
gold
piece
it
was
not
a
napoleon
it
was
one
of
those
perfectly
new
twenty
franc
pieces
of
the
restoration
on
whose
effigy
the
little
prussian
queue
had
replaced
the
laurel
wreath
cosette
was
dazzled
her
destiny
began
to
intoxicate
her
she
did
not
know
what
a
gold
piece
was
she
had
never
seen
one
she
hid
it
quickly
in
her
pocket
as
though
she
had
stolen
it
still
she
felt
that
it
really
was
hers
she
guessed
whence
her
gift
had
come
but
the
joy
which
she
experienced
was
full
of
fear
she
was
happy
above
all
she
was
stupefied
such
magnificent
and
beautiful
things
did
not
appear
real
the
doll
frightened
her
the
gold
piece
frightened
her
she
trembled
vaguely
in
the
presence
of
this
magnificence
the
stranger
alone
did
not
frighten
her
on
the
contrary
he
reassured
her
ever
since
the
preceding
evening
amid
all
her
amazement
even
in
her
sleep
she
had
been
thinking
in
her
little
childish
mind
of
that
man
who
seemed
to
be
so
poor
and
so
sad
and
who
was
so
rich
and
so
kind
everything
had
changed
for
her
since
she
had
met
that
good
man
in
the
forest
cosette
less
happy
than
the
most
insignificant
swallow
of
heaven
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
take
refuge
under
a
mother
s
shadow
and
under
a
wing
for
the
last
five
years
that
is
to
say
as
far
back
as
her
memory
ran
the
poor
child
had
shivered
and
trembled
she
had
always
been
exposed
completely
naked
to
the
sharp
wind
of
adversity
now
it
seemed
to
her
she
was
clothed
formerly
her
soul
had
seemed
cold
now
it
was
warm
cosette
was
no
longer
afraid
of
the
thenardier
she
was
no
longer
alone
there
was
some
one
there
she
hastily
set
about
her
regular
morning
duties
that
louis
which
she
had
about
her
in
the
very
apron
pocket
whence
the
fifteen
sou
piece
had
fallen
on
the
night
before
distracted
her
thoughts
she
dared
not
touch
it
but
she
spent
five
minutes
in
gazing
at
it
with
her
tongue
hanging
out
if
the
truth
must
be
told
as
she
swept
the
staircase
she
paused
remained
standing
there
motionless
forgetful
of
her
broom
and
of
the
entire
universe
occupied
in
gazing
at
that
star
which
was
blazing
at
the
bottom
of
her
pocket
it
was
during
one
of
these
periods
of
contemplation
that
the
thenardier
joined
her
she
had
gone
in
search
of
cosette
at
her
husband
s
orders
what
was
quite
unprecedented
she
neither
struck
her
nor
said
an
insulting
word
to
her
cosette
she
said
almost
gently
come
immediately
an
instant
later
cosette
entered
the
public
room
the
stranger
took
up
the
bundle
which
he
had
brought
and
untied
it
this
bundle
contained
a
little
woollen
gown
an
apron
a
fustian
bodice
a
kerchief
a
petticoat
woollen
stockings
shoes
a
complete
outfit
for
a
girl
of
seven
years
all
was
black
my
child
said
the
man
take
these
and
go
and
dress
yourself
quickly
daylight
was
appearing
when
those
of
the
inhabitants
of
montfermeil
who
had
begun
to
open
their
doors
beheld
a
poorly
clad
old
man
leading
a
little
girl
dressed
in
mourning
and
carrying
a
pink
doll
in
her
arms
pass
along
the
road
to
paris
they
were
going
in
the
direction
of
livry
it
was
our
man
and
cosette
no
one
knew
the
man
as
cosette
was
no
longer
in
rags
many
did
not
recognize
her
cosette
was
going
away
with
whom
she
did
not
know
whither
she
knew
not
all
that
she
understood
was
that
she
was
leaving
the
thenardier
tavern
behind
her
no
one
had
thought
of
bidding
her
farewell
nor
had
she
thought
of
taking
leave
of
any
one
she
was
leaving
that
hated
and
hating
house
poor
gentle
creature
whose
heart
had
been
repressed
up
to
that
hour
cosette
walked
along
gravely
with
her
large
eyes
wide
open
and
gazing
at
the
sky
she
had
put
her
louis
in
the
pocket
of
her
new
apron
from
time
to
time
she
bent
down
and
glanced
at
it
then
she
looked
at
the
good
man
she
felt
something
as
though
she
were
beside
the
good
god
chapter

he
who
seeks
to
better
himself
may
render
his
situation
worse
madame
thenardier
had
allowed
her
husband
to
have
his
own
way
as
was
her
wont
she
had
expected
great
results
when
the
man
and
cosette
had
taken
their
departure
thenardier
allowed
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
to
elapse
then
he
took
her
aside
and
showed
her
the
fifteen
hundred
francs
is
that
all
said
she
it
was
the
first
time
since
they
had
set
up
housekeeping
that
she
had
dared
to
criticise
one
of
the
master
s
acts
the
blow
told
you
are
right
in
sooth
said
he
i
am
a
fool
give
me
my
hat
he
folded
up
the
three
bank
bills
thrust
them
into
his
pocket
and
ran
out
in
all
haste
but
he
made
a
mistake
and
turned
to
the
right
first
some
neighbors
of
whom
he
made
inquiries
put
him
on
the
track
again
the
lark
and
the
man
had
been
seen
going
in
the
direction
of
livry
he
followed
these
hints
walking
with
great
strides
and
talking
to
himself
the
while
that
man
is
evidently
a
million
dressed
in
yellow
and
i
am
an
animal
first
he
gave
twenty
sous
then
five
francs
then
fifty
francs
then
fifteen
hundred
francs
all
with
equal
readiness
he
would
have
given
fifteen
thousand
francs
but
i
shall
overtake
him
and
then
that
bundle
of
clothes
prepared
beforehand
for
the
child
all
that
was
singular
many
mysteries
lay
concealed
under
it
one
does
not
let
mysteries
out
of
one
s
hand
when
one
has
once
grasped
them
the
secrets
of
the
wealthy
are
sponges
of
gold
one
must
know
how
to
subject
them
to
pressure
all
these
thoughts
whirled
through
his
brain
i
am
an
animal
said
he
when
one
leaves
montfermeil
and
reaches
the
turn
which
the
road
takes
that
runs
to
livry
it
can
be
seen
stretching
out
before
one
to
a
great
distance
across
the
plateau
on
arriving
there
he
calculated
that
he
ought
to
be
able
to
see
the
old
man
and
the
child
he
looked
as
far
as
his
vision
reached
and
saw
nothing
he
made
fresh
inquiries
but
he
had
wasted
time
some
passers
by
informed
him
that
the
man
and
child
of
whom
he
was
in
search
had
gone
towards
the
forest
in
the
direction
of
gagny
he
hastened
in
that
direction
they
were
far
in
advance
of
him
but
a
child
walks
slowly
and
he
walked
fast
and
then
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
country
all
at
once
he
paused
and
dealt
himself
a
blow
on
his
forehead
like
a
man
who
has
forgotten
some
essential
point
and
who
is
ready
to
retrace
his
steps
i
ought
to
have
taken
my
gun
said
he
to
himself
thenardier
was
one
of
those
double
natures
which
sometimes
pass
through
our
midst
without
our
being
aware
of
the
fact
and
who
disappear
without
our
finding
them
out
because
destiny
has
only
exhibited
one
side
of
them
it
is
the
fate
of
many
men
to
live
thus
half
submerged
in
a
calm
and
even
situation
thenardier
possessed
all
that
is
required
to
make
we
will
not
say
to
be
what
people
have
agreed
to
call
an
honest
trader
a
good
bourgeois
at
the
same
time
certain
circumstances
being
given
certain
shocks
arriving
to
bring
his
under
nature
to
the
surface
he
had
all
the
requisites
for
a
blackguard
he
was
a
shopkeeper
in
whom
there
was
some
taint
of
the
monster
satan
must
have
occasionally
crouched
down
in
some
corner
of
the
hovel
in
which
thenardier
dwelt
and
have
fallen
a
dreaming
in
the
presence
of
this
hideous
masterpiece
after
a
momentary
hesitation
bah
he
thought
they
will
have
time
to
make
their
escape
and
he
pursued
his
road
walking
rapidly
straight
ahead
and
with
almost
an
air
of
certainty
with
the
sagacity
of
a
fox
scenting
a
covey
of
partridges
in
truth
when
he
had
passed
the
ponds
and
had
traversed
in
an
oblique
direction
the
large
clearing
which
lies
on
the
right
of
the
avenue
de
bellevue
and
reached
that
turf
alley
which
nearly
makes
the
circuit
of
the
hill
and
covers
the
arch
of
the
ancient
aqueduct
of
the
abbey
of
chelles
he
caught
sight
over
the
top
of
the
brushwood
of
the
hat
on
which
he
had
already
erected
so
many
conjectures
it
was
that
man
s
hat
the
brushwood
was
not
high
thenardier
recognized
the
fact
that
the
man
and
cosette
were
sitting
there
the
child
could
not
be
seen
on
account
of
her
small
size
but
the
head
of
her
doll
was
visible
thenardier
was
not
mistaken
the
man
was
sitting
there
and
letting
cosette
get
somewhat
rested
the
inn
keeper
walked
round
the
brushwood
and
presented
himself
abruptly
to
the
eyes
of
those
whom
he
was
in
search
of
pardon
excuse
me
sir
he
said
quite
breathless
but
here
are
your
fifteen
hundred
francs
so
saying
he
handed
the
stranger
the
three
bank
bills
the
man
raised
his
eyes
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
thenardier
replied
respectfully
it
means
sir
that
i
shall
take
back
cosette
cosette
shuddered
and
pressed
close
to
the
old
man
he
replied
gazing
to
the
very
bottom
of
thenardier
s
eyes
the
while
and
enunciating
every
syllable
distinctly
you
are
go
ing
to
take
back
co
sette
yes
sir
i
am
i
will
tell
you
i
have
considered
the
matter
in
fact
i
have
not
the
right
to
give
her
to
you
i
am
an
honest
man
you
see
this
child
does
not
belong
to
me
she
belongs
to
her
mother
it
was
her
mother
who
confided
her
to
me
i
can
only
resign
her
to
her
mother
you
will
say
to
me
but
her
mother
is
dead
good
in
that
case
i
can
only
give
the
child
up
to
the
person
who
shall
bring
me
a
writing
signed
by
her
mother
to
the
effect
that
i
am
to
hand
the
child
over
to
the
person
therein
mentioned
that
is
clear
the
man
without
making
any
reply
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
thenardier
beheld
the
pocket
book
of
bank
bills
make
its
appearance
once
more
the
tavern
keeper
shivered
with
joy
good
thought
he
let
us
hold
firm
he
is
going
to
bribe
me
before
opening
the
pocket
book
the
traveller
cast
a
glance
about
him
the
spot
was
absolutely
deserted
there
was
not
a
soul
either
in
the
woods
or
in
the
valley
the
man
opened
his
pocket
book
once
more
and
drew
from
it
not
the
handful
of
bills
which
thenardier
expected
but
a
simple
little
paper
which
he
unfolded
and
presented
fully
open
to
the
inn
keeper
saying
you
are
right
read
thenardier
took
the
paper
and
read

monsieur
thenardier
you
will
deliver
cosette
to
this
person
you
will
be
paid
for
all
the
little
things
i
have
the
honor
to
salute
you
with
respect
fantine
you
know
that
signature
resumed
the
man
it
certainly
was
fantine
s
signature
thenardier
recognized
it
there
was
no
reply
to
make
he
experienced
two
violent
vexations
the
vexation
of
renouncing
the
bribery
which
he
had
hoped
for
and
the
vexation
of
being
beaten
the
man
added
you
may
keep
this
paper
as
your
receipt
thenardier
retreated
in
tolerably
good
order
this
signature
is
fairly
well
imitated
he
growled
between
his
teeth
however
let
it
go
then
he
essayed
a
desperate
effort
it
is
well
sir
he
said
since
you
are
the
person
but
i
must
be
paid
for
all
those
little
things
a
great
deal
is
owing
to
me
the
man
rose
to
his
feet
filliping
the
dust
from
his
thread
bare
sleeve
monsieur
thenardier
in
january
last
the
mother
reckoned
that
she
owed
you
one
hundred
and
twenty
francs
in
february
you
sent
her
a
bill
of
five
hundred
francs
you
received
three
hundred
francs
at
the
end
of
february
and
three
hundred
francs
at
the
beginning
of
march
since
then
nine
months
have
elapsed
at
fifteen
francs
a
month
the
price
agreed
upon
which
makes
one
hundred
and
thirty
five
francs
you
had
received
one
hundred
francs
too
much
that
makes
thirty
five
still
owing
you
i
have
just
given
you
fifteen
hundred
francs
thenardier
s
sensations
were
those
of
the
wolf
at
the
moment
when
he
feels
himself
nipped
and
seized
by
the
steel
jaw
of
the
trap
who
is
this
devil
of
a
man
he
thought
he
did
what
the
wolf
does
he
shook
himself
audacity
had
succeeded
with
him
once
monsieur
i
don
t
know
your
name
he
said
resolutely
and
this
time
casting
aside
all
respectful
ceremony
i
shall
take
back
cosette
if
you
do
not
give
me
a
thousand
crowns
the
stranger
said
tranquilly
come
cosette
he
took
cosette
by
his
left
hand
and
with
his
right
he
picked
up
his
cudgel
which
was
lying
on
the
ground
thenardier
noted
the
enormous
size
of
the
cudgel
and
the
solitude
of
the
spot
the
man
plunged
into
the
forest
with
the
child
leaving
the
inn
keeper
motionless
and
speechless
while
they
were
walking
away
thenardier
scrutinized
his
huge
shoulders
which
were
a
little
rounded
and
his
great
fists
then
bringing
his
eyes
back
to
his
own
person
they
fell
upon
his
feeble
arms
and
his
thin
hands
i
really
must
have
been
exceedingly
stupid
not
to
have
thought
to
bring
my
gun
he
said
to
himself
since
i
was
going
hunting
however
the
inn
keeper
did
not
give
up
i
want
to
know
where
he
is
going
said
he
and
he
set
out
to
follow
them
at
a
distance
two
things
were
left
on
his
hands
an
irony
in
the
shape
of
the
paper
signed
fantine
and
a
consolation
the
fifteen
hundred
francs
the
man
led
cosette
off
in
the
direction
of
livry
and
bondy
he
walked
slowly
with
drooping
head
in
an
attitude
of
reflection
and
sadness
the
winter
had
thinned
out
the
forest
so
that
thenardier
did
not
lose
them
from
sight
although
he
kept
at
a
good
distance
the
man
turned
round
from
time
to
time
and
looked
to
see
if
he
was
being
followed
all
at
once
he
caught
sight
of
thenardier
he
plunged
suddenly
into
the
brushwood
with
cosette
where
they
could
both
hide
themselves
the
deuce
said
thenardier
and
he
redoubled
his
pace
the
thickness
of
the
undergrowth
forced
him
to
draw
nearer
to
them
when
the
man
had
reached
the
densest
part
of
the
thicket
he
wheeled
round
it
was
in
vain
that
thenardier
sought
to
conceal
himself
in
the
branches
he
could
not
prevent
the
man
seeing
him
the
man
cast
upon
him
an
uneasy
glance
then
elevated
his
head
and
continued
his
course
the
inn
keeper
set
out
again
in
pursuit
thus
they
continued
for
two
or
three
hundred
paces
all
at
once
the
man
turned
round
once
more
he
saw
the
inn
keeper
this
time
he
gazed
at
him
with
so
sombre
an
air
that
thenardier
decided
that
it
was
useless
to
proceed
further
thenardier
retraced
his
steps

jean
valjean
was
not
dead
when
he
fell
into
the
sea
or
rather
when
he
threw
himself
into
it
he
was
not
ironed
as
we
have
seen
he
swam
under
water
until
he
reached
a
vessel
at
anchor
to
which
a
boat
was
moored
he
found
means
of
hiding
himself
in
this
boat
until
night
at
night
he
swam
off
again
and
reached
the
shore
a
little
way
from
cape
brun
there
as
he
did
not
lack
money
he
procured
clothing
a
small
country
house
in
the
neighborhood
of
balaguier
was
at
that
time
the
dressing
room
of
escaped
convicts

specialty
then
jean
valjean
like
all
the
sorry
fugitives
who
are
seeking
to
evade
the
vigilance
of
the
law
and
social
fatality
pursued
an
obscure
and
undulating
itinerary
he
found
his
first
refuge
at
pradeaux
near
beausset
then
he
directed
his
course
towards
grand
villard
near
briancon
in
the
hautes
alpes
it
was
a
fumbling
and
uneasy
flight
a
mole

whose
branchings
are
untraceable
later
on
some
trace
of
his
passage
into

discovered
in

at

at

canton
of

gonaguet
he
reached
paris
we
have
just
seen
him
at
montfermeil
his
first
care
on
arriving
in
paris
had
been
to
buy
mourning
clothes
for
a
little
girl
of
from
seven
to
eight
years
of
age
then
to
procure
a
lodging
that
done
he
had
betaken
himself
to
montfermeil
it
will
be
remembered
that
already
during
his
preceding
escape
he
had
made
a
mysterious
trip
thither
or
somewhere
in
that
neighborhood
of
which
the
law
had
gathered
an
inkling
however
he
was
thought
to
be
dead
and
this
still
further
increased
the
obscurity
which
had
gathered
about
him
at
paris
one
of
the
journals
which
chronicled
the
fact
fell
into
his
hands
he
felt
reassured
and
almost
at
peace
as
though
he
had
really
been
dead
on
the
evening
of
the
day
when
jean
valjean
rescued
cosette
from
the
claws
of
the
thenardiers
he
returned
to
paris
he
re
entered
it
at
nightfall
with
the
child
by

of

there
he
entered
a

i
master
gorbeau
forty
years
ago
a
rambler
who
had
ventured
into
that
unknown
country
of
the
salpetriere
and
who
had
mounted
to
the
barriere
d
italie
by
way
of
the
boulevard
reached
a
point
where
it
might
be
said
that
paris
disappeared
it
was
no
longer
solitude
for
there
were
passers
by
it
was
not
the
country
for
there
were
houses
and
streets
it
was
not
the
city
for
the
streets
had
ruts
like
highways
and
the
grass
grew
in
them
it
was
not
a
village
the
houses
were
too
lofty
what
was
it
then
it
was
an
inhabited
spot
where
there
was
no
one
it
was
a
desert
place
where
there
was
some
one
it
was
a
boulevard
of
the
great
city
a
street
of
paris
more
wild
at
night
than
the
forest
more
gloomy
by
day
than
a
cemetery
it
was
the
old
quarter
of
the
marche
aux
chevaux
the
rambler
if
he
risked
himself
outside
the
four
decrepit
walls
of
this
marche
aux
chevaux
if
he
consented
even
to
pass
beyond
the
rue
du
petit
banquier
after
leaving
on
his
right
a
garden
protected
by
high
walls
then
a
field
in
which
tan
bark
mills
rose
like
gigantic
beaver
huts
then
an
enclosure
encumbered
with
timber
with
a
heap
of
stumps
sawdust
and
shavings
on
which
stood
a
large
dog
barking
then
a
long
low
utterly
dilapidated
wall
with
a
little
black
door
in
mourning
laden
with
mosses
which
were
covered
with
flowers
in
the
spring
then
in
the
most
deserted
spot
a
frightful
and
decrepit
building
on
which
ran
the
inscription
in
large
letters
post
no
bills
this
daring
rambler
would
have
reached
little
known
latitudes
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
des
vignes
saint
marcel
there
near
a
factory
and
between
two
garden
walls
there
could
be
seen
at
that
epoch
a
mean
building
which
at
the
first
glance
seemed
as
small
as
a
thatched
hovel
and
which
was
in
reality
as
large
as
a
cathedral
it
presented
its
side
and
gable
to
the
public
road
hence
its
apparent
diminutiveness
nearly
the
whole
of
the
house
was
hidden
only
the
door
and
one
window
could
be
seen
this
hovel
was
only
one
story
high
the
first
detail
that
struck
the
observer
was
that
the
door
could
never
have
been
anything
but
the
door
of
a
hovel
while
the
window
if
it
had
been
carved
out
of
dressed
stone
instead
of
being
in
rough
masonry
might
have
been
the
lattice
of
a
lordly
mansion
the
door
was
nothing
but
a
collection
of
worm
eaten
planks
roughly
bound
together
by
cross
beams
which
resembled
roughly
hewn
logs
it
opened
directly
on
a
steep
staircase
of
lofty
steps
muddy
chalky
plaster
stained
dusty
steps
of
the
same
width
as
itself
which
could
be
seen
from
the
street
running
straight
up
like
a
ladder
and
disappearing
in
the
darkness
between
two
walls
the
top
of
the
shapeless
bay
into
which
this
door
shut
was
masked
by
a
narrow
scantling
in
the
centre
of
which
a
triangular
hole
had
been
sawed
which
served
both
as
wicket
and
air
hole
when
the
door
was
closed
on
the
inside
of
the
door
the
figures
52
had
been
traced
with
a
couple
of
strokes
of
a
brush
dipped
in
ink
and
above
the
scantling
the
same
hand
had
daubed
the
number
50
so
that
one
hesitated
where
was
one
above
the
door
it
said
number
50
the
inside
replied
no
number
52
no
one
knows
what
dust
colored
figures
were
suspended
like
draperies
from
the
triangular
opening
the
window
was
large
sufficiently
elevated
garnished
with
venetian
blinds
and
with
a
frame
in
large
square
panes
only
these
large
panes
were
suffering
from
various
wounds
which
were
both
concealed
and
betrayed
by
an
ingenious
paper
bandage
and
the
blinds
dislocated
and
unpasted
threatened
passers
by
rather
than
screened
the
occupants
the
horizontal
slats
were
missing
here
and
there
and
had
been
naively
replaced
with
boards
nailed
on
perpendicularly
so
that
what
began
as
a
blind
ended
as
a
shutter
this
door
with
an
unclean
and
this
window
with
an
honest
though
dilapidated
air
thus
beheld
on
the
same
house
produced
the
effect
of
two
incomplete
beggars
walking
side
by
side
with
different
miens
beneath
the
same
rags
the
one
having
always
been
a
mendicant
and
the
other
having
once
been
a
gentleman
the
staircase
led
to
a
very
vast
edifice
which
resembled
a
shed
which
had
been
converted
into
a
house
this
edifice
had
for
its
intestinal
tube
a
long
corridor
on
which
opened
to
right
and
left
sorts
of
compartments
of
varied
dimensions
which
were
inhabitable
under
stress
of
circumstances
and
rather
more
like
stalls
than
cells
these
chambers
received
their
light
from
the
vague
waste
grounds
in
the
neighborhood
all
this
was
dark
disagreeable
wan
melancholy
sepulchral
traversed
according
as
the
crevices
lay
in
the
roof
or
in
the
door
by
cold
rays
or
by
icy
winds
an
interesting
and
picturesque
peculiarity
of
this
sort
of
dwelling
is
the
enormous
size
of
the
spiders
to
the
left
of
the
entrance
door
on
the
boulevard
side
at
about
the
height
of
a
man
from
the
ground
a
small
window
which
had
been
walled
up
formed
a
square
niche
full
of
stones
which
the
children
had
thrown
there
as
they
passed
by
a
portion
of
this
building
has
recently
been
demolished
from
what
still
remains
of
it
one
can
form
a
judgment
as
to
what
it
was
in
former
days
as
a
whole
it
was
not
over
a
hundred
years
old
a
hundred
years
is
youth
in
a
church
and
age
in
a
house
it
seems
as
though
man
s
lodging
partook
of
his
ephemeral
character
and
god
s
house
of
his
eternity
the
postmen
called
the
house
number
50
52
but
it
was
known
in
the
neighborhood
as
the
gorbeau
house
let
us
explain
whence
this
appellation
was
derived
collectors
of
petty
details
who
become
herbalists
of
anecdotes
and
prick
slippery
dates
into
their
memories
with
a
pin
know
that
there
was
in
paris
during
the
last
century
about
1770
two
attorneys
at
the
chatelet
named
one
corbeau
raven
the
other
renard
fox
the
two
names
had
been
forestalled
by
la
fontaine
the
opportunity
was
too
fine
for
the
lawyers
they
made
the
most
of
it
a
parody
was
immediately
put
in
circulation
in
the
galleries
of
the
court
house
in
verses
that
limped

the
two
honest
practitioners
embarrassed
by
the
jests
and
finding
the
bearing
of
their
heads
interfered
with
by
the
shouts
of
laughter
which
followed
them
resolved
to
get
rid
of
their
names
and
hit
upon
the
expedient
of
applying
to
the
king
their
petition
was
presented
to
louis
xv
on
the
same
day
when
the
papal
nuncio
on
the
one
hand
and
the
cardinal
de
la
roche
aymon
on
the
other
both
devoutly
kneeling
were
each
engaged
in
putting
on
in
his
majesty
s
presence
a
slipper
on
the
bare
feet
of
madame
du
barry
who
had
just
got
out
of
bed
the
king
who
was
laughing
continued
to
laugh
passed
gayly
from
the
two
bishops
to
the
two
lawyers
and
bestowed
on
these
limbs
of
the
law
their
former
names
or
nearly
so
by
the
kings
command
maitre
corbeau
was
permitted
to
add
a
tail
to
his
initial
letter
and
to
call
himself
gorbeau
maitre
renard
was
less
lucky
all
he
obtained
was
leave
to
place
a
p
in
front
of
his
r
and
to
call
himself
prenard
so
that
the
second
name
bore
almost
as
much
resemblance
as
the
first
now
according
to
local
tradition
this
maitre
gorbeau
had
been
the
proprietor
of
the
building
numbered
50
52
on
the
boulevard
de
l
hopital
he
was
even
the
author
of
the
monumental
window
hence
the
edifice
bore
the
name
of
the
gorbeau
house
opposite
this
house
among
the
trees
of
the
boulevard
rose
a
great
elm
which
was
three
quarters
dead
almost
directly
facing
it
opens
the
rue
de
la
barriere
des
gobelins
a
street
then
without
houses
unpaved
planted
with
unhealthy
trees
which
was
green
or
muddy
according
to
the
season
and
which
ended
squarely
in
the
exterior
wall
of
paris
an
odor
of
copperas
issued
in
puffs
from
the
roofs
of
the
neighboring
factory
the
barrier
was
close
at
hand
in
1823
the
city
wall
was
still
in
existence
this
barrier
itself
evoked
gloomy
fancies
in
the
mind
it
was
the
road
to
bicetre
it
was
through
it
that
under
the
empire
and
the
restoration
prisoners
condemned
to
death
re
entered
paris
on
the
day
of
their
execution
it
was
there
that
about
1829
was
committed
that
mysterious
assassination
called
the
assassination
of
the
fontainebleau
barrier
whose
authors
justice
was
never
able
to
discover
a
melancholy
problem
which
has
never
been
elucidated
a
frightful
enigma
which
has
never
been
unriddled
take
a
few
steps
and
you
come
upon
that
fatal
rue
croulebarbe
where
ulbach
stabbed
the
goat
girl
of
ivry
to
the
sound
of
thunder
as
in
the
melodramas
a
few
paces
more
and
you
arrive
at
the
abominable
pollarded
elms
of
the
barriere
saint
jacques
that
expedient
of
the
philanthropist
to
conceal
the
scaffold
that
miserable
and
shameful
place
de
grove
of
a
shop
keeping
and
bourgeois
society
which
recoiled
before
the
death
penalty
neither
daring
to
abolish
it
with
grandeur
nor
to
uphold
it
with
authority
leaving
aside
this
place
saint
jacques
which
was
as
it
were
predestined
and
which
has
always
been
horrible
probably
the
most
mournful
spot
on
that
mournful
boulevard
seven
and
thirty
years
ago
was
the
spot
which
even
to
day
is
so
unattractive
where
stood
the
building
number
50
52
bourgeois
houses
only
began
to
spring
up
there
twenty
five
years
later
the
place
was
unpleasant
in
addition
to
the
gloomy
thoughts
which
assailed
one
there
one
was
conscious
of
being
between
the
salpetriere
a
glimpse
of
whose
dome
could
be
seen
and
bicetre
whose
outskirts
one
was
fairly
touching
that
is
to
say
between
the
madness
of
women
and
the
madness
of
men
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
one
could
perceive
nothing
but
the
abattoirs
the
city
wall
and
the
fronts
of
a
few
factories
resembling
barracks
or
monasteries
everywhere
about
stood
hovels
rubbish
ancient
walls
blackened
like
cerecloths
new
white
walls
like
winding
sheets
everywhere
parallel
rows
of
trees
buildings
erected
on
a
line
flat
constructions
long
cold
rows
and
the
melancholy
sadness
of
right
angles
not
an
unevenness
of
the
ground
not
a
caprice
in
the
architecture
not
a
fold
the
ensemble
was
glacial
regular
hideous
nothing
oppresses
the
heart
like
symmetry
it
is
because
symmetry
is
ennui
and
ennui
is
at
the
very
foundation
of
grief
despair
yawns
something
more
terrible
than
a
hell
where
one
suffers
may
be
imagined
and
that
is
a
hell
where
one
is
bored
if
such
a
hell
existed
that
bit
of
the
boulevard
de
l
hopital
might
have
formed
the
entrance
to
it
nevertheless
at
nightfall
at
the
moment
when
the
daylight
is
vanishing
especially
in
winter
at
the
hour
when
the
twilight
breeze
tears
from
the
elms
their
last
russet
leaves
when
the
darkness
is
deep
and
starless
or
when
the
moon
and
the
wind
are
making
openings
in
the
clouds
and
losing
themselves
in
the
shadows
this
boulevard
suddenly
becomes
frightful
the
black
lines
sink
inwards
and
are
lost
in
the
shades
like
morsels
of
the
infinite
the
passer
by
cannot
refrain
from
recalling
the
innumerable
traditions
of
the
place
which
are
connected
with
the
gibbet
the
solitude
of
this
spot
where
so
many
crimes
have
been
committed
had
something
terrible
about
it
one
almost
had
a
presentiment
of
meeting
with
traps
in
that
darkness
all
the
confused
forms
of
the
darkness
seemed
suspicious
and
the
long
hollow
square
of
which
one
caught
a
glimpse
between
each
tree
seemed
graves
by
day
it
was
ugly
in
the
evening
melancholy
by
night
it
was
sinister
in
summer
at
twilight
one
saw
here
and
there
a
few
old
women
seated
at
the
foot
of
the
elm
on
benches
mouldy
with
rain
these
good
old
women
were
fond
of
begging
however
this
quarter
which
had
a
superannuated
rather
than
an
antique
air
was
tending
even
then
to
transformation
even
at
that
time
any
one
who
was
desirous
of
seeing
it
had
to
make
haste
each
day
some
detail
of
the
whole
effect
was
disappearing
for
the
last
twenty
years
the
station
of
the
orleans
railway
has
stood
beside
the
old
faubourg
and
distracted
it
as
it
does
to
day
wherever
it
is
placed
on
the
borders
of
a
capital
a
railway
station
is
the
death
of
a
suburb
and
the
birth
of
a
city
it
seems
as
though
around
these
great
centres
of
the
movements
of
a
people
the
earth
full
of
germs
trembled
and
yawned
to
engulf
the
ancient
dwellings
of
men
and
to
allow
new
ones
to
spring
forth
at
the
rattle
of
these
powerful
machines
at
the
breath
of
these
monstrous
horses
of
civilization
which
devour
coal
and
vomit
fire
the
old
houses
crumble
and
new
ones
rise
since
the
orleans
railway
has
invaded
the
region
of
the
salpetriere
the
ancient
narrow
streets
which
adjoin
the
moats
saint
victor
and
the
jardin
des
plantes
tremble
as
they
are
violently
traversed
three
or
four
times
each
day
by
those
currents
of
coach
fiacres
and
omnibuses
which
in
a
given
time
crowd
back
the
houses
to
the
right
and
the
left
for
there
are
things
which
are
odd
when
said
that
are
rigorously
exact
and
just
as
it
is
true
to
say
that
in
large
cities
the
sun
makes
the
southern
fronts
of
houses
to
vegetate
and
grow
it
is
certain
that
the
frequent
passage
of
vehicles
enlarges
streets
the
symptoms
of
a
new
life
are
evident
in
this
old
provincial
quarter
in
the
wildest
nooks
the
pavement
shows
itself
the
sidewalks
begin
to
crawl
and
to
grow
longer
even
where
there
are
as
yet
no
pedestrians
one
morning
a
memorable
morning
in
july
1845
black
pots
of
bitumen
were
seen
smoking
there
on
that
day
it
might
be
said
that
civilization
had
arrived
in

that

had
entered

mattress
laid
on
the
floor
a
table
and
several
chairs
a
stove
in
which
a
fire
was
burning
and
whose
embers
were
visible
stood
in
one
corner
a
lantern
on
the
boulevard
cast
a
vague
light
into
this
poor
room
at
the
extreme
end
there
was
a
dressing
room
with
a
folding
bed
jean
valjean
carried
the
child
to
this
bed
and
laid
her
down
there
without
waking
her
he
struck
a
match
and
lighted
a
candle
all
this
was
prepared
beforehand
on
the
table
and
as
he
had
done
on
the
previous
evening
he
began
to
scrutinize
cosette
s
face
with
a
gaze
full
of
ecstasy
in
which
the
expression
of
kindness
and
tenderness
almost
amounted
to
aberration
the
little
girl
with
that
tranquil
confidence
which
belongs
only
to
extreme
strength
and
extreme
weakness
had
fallen
asleep
without
knowing
with
whom
she
was
and
continued
to
sleep
without
knowing
where
she
was
jean
valjean
bent
down
and
kissed
that
child
s
hand
nine
months
before
he
had
kissed
the
hand
of
the
mother
who
had
also
just
fallen
asleep
the
same
sad
piercing
religious
sentiment
filled
his
heart
he
knelt
beside
cosette
s
bed
lt
was
broad
daylight
and
the
child
still
slept
a
wan
ray
of
the
december
sun
penetrated
the
window
of
the
attic
and
lay
upon
the
ceiling
in
long
threads
of
light
and
shade
all
at
once
a
heavily
laden
carrier
s
cart
which
was
passing
along
the
boulevard
shook
the
frail
bed
like
a
clap
of
thunder
and
made
it
quiver
from
top
to
bottom
yes
madame
cried
cosette
waking
with
a
start
here
i
am
here
i
am
and
she
sprang
out
of
bed
her
eyes
still
half
shut
with
the
heaviness
of
sleep
extending
her
arms
towards
the
corner
of
the
wall
ah
mon
dieu
my
broom
said
she
she
opened
her
eyes
wide
now
and
beheld
the
smiling
countenance
of
jean
valjean
ah
so
it
is
true
said
the
child
good
morning
monsieur
children
accept
joy
and
happiness
instantly
and
familiarly
being
themselves
by
nature
joy
and
happiness
cosette
caught
sight
of
catherine
at
the
foot
of
her
bed
and
took
possession
of
her
and
as
she
played
she
put
a
hundred
questions
to
jean
valjean
where
was
she
was
paris
very
large
was
madame
thenardier
very
far
away
was
she
to
go
back
etc
etc
all
at
once
she
exclaimed
how
pretty
it
is
here
it
was
a
frightful
hole
but
she
felt
free
must
i
sweep
she
resumed
at
last
play
said
jean
valjean
the
day
passed
thus
cosette
without
troubling
herself
to
understand
anything
was
inexpressibly
happy
with
that
doll
and
that
kind
man
chapter
iii
two
misfortunes
make
one
piece
of
good
fortune
on
the
following
morning
at
daybreak
jean
valjean
was
still
by
cosette
s
bedside
he
watched
there
motionless
waiting
for
her
to
wake
some
new
thing
had
come
into
his
soul
jean
valjean
had
never
loved
anything
for
twenty
five
years
he
had
been
alone
in
the
world
he
had
never
been
father
lover
husband
friend
in
the
prison
he
had
been
vicious
gloomy
chaste
ignorant
and
shy
the
heart
of
that
ex
convict
was
full
of
virginity
his
sister
and
his
sister
s
children
had
left
him
only
a
vague
and
far
off
memory
which
had
finally
almost
completely
vanished
he
had
made
every
effort
to
find
them
and
not
having
been
able
to
find
them
he
had
forgotten
them
human
nature
is
made
thus
the
other
tender
emotions
of
his
youth
if
he
had
ever
had
any
had
fallen
into
an
abyss
when
he
saw
cosette
when
he
had
taken
possession
of
her
carried
her
off
and
delivered
her
he
felt
his
heart
moved
within
him
all
the
passion
and
affection
within
him
awoke
and
rushed
towards
that
child
he
approached
the
bed
where
she
lay
sleeping
and
trembled
with
joy
he
suffered
all
the
pangs
of
a
mother
and
he
knew
not
what
it
meant
for
that
great
and
singular
movement
of
a
heart
which
begins
to
love
is
a
very
obscure
and
a
very
sweet
thing
poor
old
man
with
a
perfectly
new
heart
only
as
he
was
five
and
fifty
and
cosette
eight
years
of
age
all
that
might
have
been
love
in
the
whole
course
of
his
life
flowed
together
into
a
sort
of
ineffable
light
it
was
the
second
white
apparition
which
he
had
encountered
the
bishop
had
caused
the
dawn
of
virtue
to
rise
on
his
horizon
cosette
caused
the
dawn
of
love
to
rise
the
early
days
passed
in
this
dazzled
state
cosette
on
her
side
had
also
unknown
to
herself
become
another
being
poor
little
thing
she
was
so
little
when
her
mother
left
her
that
she
no
longer
remembered
her
like
all
children
who
resemble
young
shoots
of
the
vine
which
cling
to
everything
she
had
tried
to
love
she
had
not
succeeded
all
had
repulsed
her
the
thenardiers
their
children
other
children
she
had
loved
the
dog
and
he
had
died
after
which
nothing
and
nobody
would
have
anything
to
do
with
her
it
is
a
sad
thing
to
say
and
we
have
already
intimated
it
that
at
eight
years
of
age
her
heart
was
cold
it
was
not
her
fault
it
was
not
the
faculty
of
loving
that
she
lacked
alas
it
was
the
possibility
thus
from
the
very
first
day
all
her
sentient
and
thinking
powers
loved
this
kind
man
she
felt
that
which
she
had
never
felt
before
a
sensation
of
expansion
the
man
no
longer
produced
on
her
the
effect
of
being
old
or
poor
she
thought
jean
valjean
handsome
just
as
she
thought
the
hovel
pretty
these
are
the
effects
of
the
dawn
of
childhood
of
joy
the
novelty
of
the
earth
and
of
life
counts
for
something
here
nothing
is
so
charming
as
the
coloring
reflection
of
happiness
on
a
garret
we
all
have
in
our
past
a
delightful
garret
nature
a
difference
of
fifty
years
had
set
a
profound
gulf
between
jean
valjean
and
cosette
destiny
filled
in
this
gulf
destiny
suddenly
united
and
wedded
with
its
irresistible
power
these
two
uprooted
existences
differing
in
age
alike
in
sorrow
one
in
fact
completed
the
other
cosette
s
instinct
sought
a
father
as
jean
valjean
s
instinct
sought
a
child
to
meet
was
to
find
each
other
at
the
mysterious
moment
when
their
hands
touched
they
were
welded
together
when
these
two
souls
perceived
each
other
they
recognized
each
other
as
necessary
to
each
other
and
embraced
each
other
closely
taking
the
words
in
their
most
comprehensive
and
absolute
sense
we
may
say
that
separated
from
every
one
by
the
walls
of
the
tomb
jean
valjean
was
the
widower
and
cosette
was
the
orphan
this
situation
caused
jean
valjean
to
become
cosette
s
father
after
a
celestial
fashion
and
in
truth
the
mysterious
impression
produced
on
cosette
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
of
chelles
by
the
hand
of
jean
valjean
grasping
hers
in
the
dark
was
not
an
illusion
but
a
reality
the
entrance
of
that
man
into
the
destiny
of
that
child
had
been
the
advent
of
god
moreover
jean
valjean
had
chosen
his
refuge
well
there
he
seemed
perfectly
secure
the
chamber
with
a
dressing
room
which
he
occupied
with
cosette
was
the
one
whose
window
opened
on
the
boulevard
this
being
the
only
window
in
the
house
no
neighbors
glances
were
to
be
feared
from
across
the
way
or
at
the
side
the
ground
floor
of
number
50
52
a
sort
of
dilapidated
penthouse
served
as
a
wagon
house
for
market
gardeners
and
no
communication
existed
between
it
and
the
first
story
it
was
separated
by
the
flooring
which
had
neither
traps
nor
stairs
and
which
formed
the
diaphragm
of
the
building
as
it
were
the
first
story
contained
as
we
have
said
numerous
chambers
and
several
attics
only
one
of
which
was
occupied
by
the
old
woman
who
took
charge
of
jean
valjean
s
housekeeping
all
the
rest
was
uninhabited
it
was
this
old
woman
ornamented
with
the
name
of
the
principal
lodger
and
in
reality
intrusted
with
the
functions
of
portress
who
had
let
him
the
lodging
on
christmas
eve
he
had
represented
himself
to
her
as
a
gentleman
of
means
who
had
been
ruined
by
spanish
bonds
who
was
coming
there
to
live
with
his
little
daughter
he
had
paid
her
six
months
in
advance
and
had
commissioned
the
old
woman
to
furnish
the
chamber
and
dressing
room
as
we
have
seen
it
was
this
good
woman
who
had
lighted
the
fire
in
the
stove
and
prepared
everything
on
the
evening
of
their
arrival
week
followed
week
these
two
beings
led
a
happy
life
in
that
hovel
cosette
laughed
chattered
and
sang
from
daybreak
children
have
their
morning
song
as
well
as
birds
it
sometimes
happened
that
jean
valjean
clasped
her
tiny
red
hand
all
cracked
with
chilblains
and
kissed
it
the
poor
child
who
was
used
to
being
beaten
did
not
know
the
meaning
of
this
and
ran
away
in
confusion
at
times
she
became
serious
and
stared
at
her
little
black
gown
cosette
was
no
longer
in
rags
she
was
in
mourning
she
had
emerged
from
misery
and
she
was
entering
into
life
jean
valjean
had
undertaken
to
teach
her
to
read
sometimes
as
he
made
the
child
spell
he
remembered
that
it
was
with
the
idea
of
doing
evil
that
he
had
learned
to
read
in
prison
this
idea
had
ended
in
teaching
a
child
to
read
then
the
ex
convict
smiled
with
the
pensive
smile
of
the
angels
he
felt
in
it
a
premeditation
from
on
high
the
will
of
some
one
who
was
not
man
and
he
became
absorbed
in
revery
good
thoughts
have
their
abysses
as
well
as
evil
ones
to
teach
cosette
to
read
and
to
let
her
play
this
constituted
nearly
the
whole
of
jean
valjean
s
existence
and
then
he
talked
of
her
mother
and
he
made
her
pray
she
called
him
father
and
knew
no
other
name
for
him
he
passed
hours
in
watching
her
dressing
and
undressing
her
doll
and
in
listening
to
her
prattle
life
henceforth
appeared
to
him
to
be
full
of
interest
men
seemed
to
him
good
and
just
he
no
longer
reproached
any
one
in
thought
he
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
not
live
to
be
a
very
old
man
now
that
this
child
loved
him
he
saw
a
whole
future
stretching
out
before
him
illuminated
by
cosette
as
by
a
charming
light
the
best
of
us
are
not
exempt
from
egotistical
thoughts
at
times
he
reflected
with
a
sort
of
joy
that
she
would
be
ugly
this
is
only
a
personal
opinion
but
to
utter
our
whole
thought
at
the
point
where
jean
valjean
had
arrived
when
he
began
to
love
cosette
it
is
by
no
means
clear
to
us
that
he
did
not
need
this
encouragement
in
order
that
he
might
persevere
in
well
doing
he
had
just
viewed
the
malice
of
men
and
the
misery
of
society
under
a
new
aspect
incomplete
aspects
which
unfortunately
only
exhibited
one
side
of
the
truth
the
fate
of
woman
as
summed
up
in
fantine
and
public
authority
as
personified
in
javert
he
had
returned
to
prison
this
time
for
having
done
right
he
had
quaffed
fresh
bitterness
disgust
and
lassitude
were
overpowering
him
even
the
memory
of
the
bishop
probably
suffered
a
temporary
eclipse
though
sure
to
reappear
later
on
luminous
and
triumphant
but
after
all
that
sacred
memory
was
growing
dim
who
knows
whether
jean
valjean
had
not
been
on
the
eve
of
growing
discouraged
and
of
falling
once
more
he
loved
and
grew
strong
again
alas
he
walked
with
no
less
indecision
than
cosette
he
protected
her
and
she
strengthened
him
thanks
to
him
she
could
walk
through
life
thanks
to
her
he
could
continue
in
virtue
he
was
that
child
s
stay
and
she
was
his
prop
oh
unfathomable
and
divine
mystery
of
the
balances
of
destiny
chapter
iv
the
remarks
of
the
principal
tenant
jean
valjean
was
prudent
enough
never
to
go
out
by
day
every
evening
at
twilight
he
walked
for
an
hour
or
two
sometimes
alone
often
with
cosette
seeking
the
most
deserted
side
alleys
of
the
boulevard
and
entering
churches
at
nightfall
he
liked
to
go
to
saint
medard
which
is
the
nearest
church
when
he
did
not
take
cosette
with
him
she
remained
with
the
old
woman
but
the
child
s
delight
was
to
go
out
with
the
good
man
she
preferred
an
hour
with
him
to
all
her
rapturous
tete
a
tetes
with
catherine
he
held
her
hand
as
they
walked
and
said
sweet
things
to
her
it
turned
out
that
cosette
was
a
very
gay
little
person
the
old
woman
attended
to
the
housekeeping
and
cooking
and
went
to
market
they
lived
soberly
always
having
a
little
fire
but
like
people
in
very
moderate
circumstances
jean
valjean
had
made
no
alterations
in
the
furniture
as
it
was
the
first
day
he
had
merely
had
the
glass
door
leading
to
cosette
s
dressing
room
replaced
by
a
solid
door
he
still
wore
his
yellow
coat
his
black
breeches
and
his
old
hat
in
the
street
he
was
taken
for
a
poor
man
it
sometimes
happened
that
kind
hearted
women
turned
back
to
bestow
a
sou
on
him
jean
valjean
accepted
the
sou
with
a
deep
bow
it
also
happened
occasionally
that
he
encountered
some
poor
wretch
asking
alms
then
he
looked
behind
him
to
make
sure
that
no
one
was
observing
him
stealthily
approached
the
unfortunate
man
put
a
piece
of
money
into
his
hand
often
a
silver
coin
and
walked
rapidly
away
this
had
its
disadvantages
he
began
to
be
known
in
the
neighborhood
under
the
name
of
the
beggar
who
gives
alms
the
old
principal
lodger
a
cross
looking
creature
who
was
thoroughly
permeated
so
far
as
her
neighbors
were
concerned
with
the
inquisitiveness
peculiar
to
envious
persons
scrutinized
jean
valjean
a
great
deal
without
his
suspecting
the
fact
she
was
a
little
deaf
which
rendered
her
talkative
there
remained
to
her
from
her
past
two
teeth
one
above
the
other
below
which
she
was
continually
knocking
against
each
other
she
had
questioned
cosette
who
had
not
been
able
to
tell
her
anything
since
she
knew
nothing
herself
except
that
she
had
come
from
montfermeil
one
morning
this
spy
saw
jean
valjean
with
an
air
which
struck
the
old
gossip
as
peculiar
entering
one
of
the
uninhabited
compartments
of
the
hovel
she
followed
him
with
the
step
of
an
old
cat
and
was
able
to
observe
him
without
being
seen
through
a
crack
in
the
door
which
was
directly
opposite
him
jean
valjean
had
his
back
turned
towards
this
door
by
way
of
greater
security
no
doubt
the
old
woman
saw
him
fumble
in
his
pocket
and
draw
thence
a
case
scissors
and
thread
then
he
began
to
rip
the
lining
of
one
of
the
skirts
of
his
coat
and
from
the
opening
he
took
a
bit
of
yellowish
paper
which
he
unfolded
the
old
woman
recognized
with
terror
the
fact
that
it
was
a
bank
bill
for
a
thousand
francs
it
was
the
second
or
third
only
that
she
had
seen
in
the
course
of
her
existence
she
fled
in
alarm
a
moment
later
jean
valjean
accosted
her
and
asked
her
to
go
and
get
this
thousand
franc
bill
changed
for
him
adding
that
it
was
his
quarterly
income
which
he
had
received
the
day
before
where
thought
the
old
woman
he
did
not
go
out
until
six
o
clock
in
the
evening
and
the
government
bank
certainly
is
not
open
at
that
hour
the
old
woman
went
to
get
the
bill
changed
and
mentioned
her
surmises
that
thousand
franc
note
commented
on
and
multiplied
produced
a
vast
amount
of
terrified
discussion
among
the
gossips
of
the
rue
des
vignes
saint
marcel
a
few
days
later
it
chanced
that
jean
valjean
was
sawing
some
wood
in
his
shirt
sleeves
in
the
corridor
the
old
woman
was
in
the
chamber
putting
things
in
order
she
was
alone
cosette
was
occupied
in
admiring
the
wood
as
it
was
sawed
the
old
woman
caught
sight
of
the
coat
hanging
on
a
nail
and
examined
it
the
lining
had
been
sewed
up
again
the
good
woman
felt
of
it
carefully
and
thought
she
observed
in
the
skirts
and
revers
thicknesses
of
paper
more
thousand
franc
bank
bills
no
doubt
she
also
noticed
that
there
were
all
sorts
of
things
in
the
pockets
not
only
the
needles
thread
and
scissors
which
she
had
seen
but
a
big
pocket
book
a
very
large
knife
and
a
suspicious
circumstance
several
wigs
of
various
colors
each
pocket
of
this
coat
had
the
air
of
being
in
a
manner
provided
against
unexpected
accidents
thus
the
inhabitants
of
the
house
reached
the
last
days
of
winter
chapter
v
a
five
franc
piece
falls
on
the
ground
and
produces
a
tumult
near
saint
medard
s
church
there
was
a
poor
man
who
was
in
the
habit
of
crouching
on
the
brink
of
a
public
well
which
had
been
condemned
and
on
whom
jean
valjean
was
fond
of
bestowing
charity
he
never
passed
this
man
without
giving
him
a
few
sous
sometimes
he
spoke
to
him
those
who
envied
this
mendicant
said
that
he
belonged
to
the
police
he
was
an
ex
beadle
of
seventy
five
who
was
constantly
mumbling
his
prayers
one
evening
as
jean
valjean
was
passing
by
when
he
had
not
cosette
with
him
he
saw
the
beggar
in
his
usual
place
beneath
the
lantern
which
had
just
been
lighted
the
man
seemed
engaged
in
prayer
according
to
his
custom
and
was
much
bent
over
jean
valjean
stepped
up
to
him
and
placed
his
customary
alms
in
his
hand
the
mendicant
raised
his
eyes
suddenly
stared
intently
at
jean
valjean
then
dropped
his
head
quickly
this
movement
was
like
a
flash
of
lightning
jean
valjean
was
seized
with
a
shudder
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
just
caught
sight
by
the
light
of
the
street
lantern
not
of
the
placid
and
beaming
visage
of
the
old
beadle
but
of
a
well
known
and
startling
face
he
experienced
the
same
impression
that
one
would
have
on
finding
one
s
self
all
of
a
sudden
face
to
face
in
the
dark
with
a
tiger
he
recoiled
terrified
petrified
daring
neither
to
breathe
to
speak
to
remain
nor
to
flee
staring
at
the
beggar
who
had
dropped
his
head
which
was
enveloped
in
a
rag
and
no
longer
appeared
to
know
that
he
was
there
at
this
strange
moment
an
instinct
possibly
the
mysterious
instinct
of
self
preservation
restrained
jean
valjean
from
uttering
a
word
the
beggar
had
the
same
figure
the
same
rags
the
same
appearance
as
he
had
every
day
bah
said
jean
valjean
i
am
mad
i
am
dreaming
impossible
and
he
returned
profoundly
troubled
he
hardly
dared
to
confess
even
to
himself
that
the
face
which
he
thought
he
had
seen
was
the
face
of
javert
that
night
on
thinking
the
matter
over
he
regretted
not
having
questioned
the
man
in
order
to
force
him
to
raise
his
head
a
second
time
on
the
following
day
at
nightfall
he
went
back
the
beggar
was
at
his
post
good
day
my
good
man
said
jean
valjean
resolutely
handing
him
a
sou
the
beggar
raised
his
head
and
replied
in
a
whining
voice
thanks
my
good
sir
it
was
unmistakably
the
ex
beadle
jean
valjean
felt
completely
reassured
he
began
to
laugh
how
the
deuce
could
i
have
thought
that
i
saw
javert
there
he
thought
am
i
going
to
lose
my
eyesight
now
and
he
thought
no
more
about
it
a
few
days
afterwards
it
might
have
been
at
eight
o
clock
in
the
evening
he
was
in
his
room
and
engaged
in
making
cosette
spell
aloud
when
he
heard
the
house
door
open
and
then
shut
again
this
struck
him
as
singular
the
old
woman
who
was
the
only
inhabitant
of
the
house
except
himself
always
went
to
bed
at
nightfall
so
that
she
might
not
burn
out
her
candles
jean
valjean
made
a
sign
to
cosette
to
be
quiet
he
heard
some
one
ascending
the
stairs
it
might
possibly
be
the
old
woman
who
might
have
fallen
ill
and
have
been
out
to
the
apothecary
s
jean
valjean
listened
the
step
was
heavy
and
sounded
like
that
of
a
man
but
the
old
woman
wore
stout
shoes
and
there
is
nothing
which
so
strongly
resembles
the
step
of
a
man
as
that
of
an
old
woman
nevertheless
jean
valjean
blew
out
his
candle
he
had
sent
cosette
to
bed
saying
to
her
in
a
low
voice
get
into
bed
very
softly
and
as
he
kissed
her
brow
the
steps
paused
jean
valjean
remained
silent
motionless
with
his
back
towards
the
door
seated
on
the
chair
from
which
he
had
not
stirred
and
holding
his
breath
in
the
dark
after
the
expiration
of
a
rather
long
interval
he
turned
round
as
he
heard
nothing
more
and
as
he
raised
his
eyes
towards
the
door
of
his
chamber
he
saw
a
light
through
the
keyhole
this
light
formed
a
sort
of
sinister
star
in
the
blackness
of
the
door
and
the
wall
there
was
evidently
some
one
there
who
was
holding
a
candle
in
his
hand
and
listening
several
minutes
elapsed
thus
and
the
light
retreated
but
he
heard
no
sound
of
footsteps
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
person
who
had
been
listening
at
the
door
had
removed
his
shoes
jean
valjean
threw
himself
all
dressed
as
he
was
on
his
bed
and
could
not
close
his
eyes
all
night
at
daybreak
just
as
he
was
falling
into
a
doze
through
fatigue
he
was
awakened
by
the
creaking
of
a
door
which
opened
on
some
attic
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
then
he
heard
the
same
masculine
footstep
which
had
ascended
the
stairs
on
the
preceding
evening
the
step
was
approaching
he
sprang
off
the
bed
and
applied
his
eye
to
the
keyhole
which
was
tolerably
large
hoping
to
see
the
person
who
had
made
his
way
by
night
into
the
house
and
had
listened
at
his
door
as
he
passed
it
was
a
man
in
fact
who
passed
this
time
without
pausing
in
front
of
jean
valjean
s
chamber
the
corridor
was
too
dark
to
allow
of
the
person
s
face
being
distinguished
but
when
the
man
reached
the
staircase
a
ray
of
light
from
without
made
it
stand
out
like
a
silhouette
and
jean
valjean
had
a
complete
view
of
his
back
the
man
was
of
lofty
stature
clad
in
a
long
frock
coat
with
a
cudgel
under
his
arm
the
formidable
neck
and
shoulders
belonged
to
javert
jean
valjean
might
have
attempted
to
catch
another
glimpse
of
him
through
his
window
opening
on
the
boulevard
but
he
would
have
been
obliged
to
open
the
window
he
dared
not
it
was
evident
that
this
man
had
entered
with
a
key
and
like
himself
who
had
given
him
that
key
what
was
the
meaning
of
this
when
the
old
woman
came
to
do
the
work
at
seven
o
clock
in
the
morning
jean
valjean
cast
a
penetrating
glance
on
her
but
he
did
not
question
her
the
good
woman
appeared
as
usual
as
she
swept
up
she
remarked
to
him
possibly
monsieur
may
have
heard
some
one
come
in
last
night
at
that
age
and
on
that
boulevard
eight
o
clock
in
the
evening
was
the
dead
of
the
night
that
is
true
by
the
way
he
replied
in
the
most
natural
tone
possible
who
was
it
it
was
a
new
lodger
who
has
come
into
the
house
said
the
old
woman
and
what
is
his
name
i
don
t
know
exactly
dumont
or
daumont
or
some
name
of
that
sort
and
who
is
this
monsieur
dumont
the
old
woman
gazed
at
him
with
her
little
polecat
eyes
and
answered
a
gentleman
of
property
like
yourself
perhaps
she
had
no
ulterior
meaning
jean
valjean
thought
he
perceived
one
when
the
old
woman
had
taken
her
departure
he
did
up
a
hundred
francs
which
he
had
in
a
cupboard
into
a
roll
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
in
spite
of
all
the
precautions
which
he
took
in
this
operation
so
that
he
might
not
be
heard
rattling
silver
a
hundred
sou
piece
escaped
from
his
hands
and
rolled
noisily
on
the
floor
when
darkness
came
on
he
descended
and
carefully
scrutinized
both
sides
of
the
boulevard
he
saw
no
one
the
boulevard
appeared
to
be
absolutely
deserted
it
is
true
that
a
person
can
conceal
himself
behind
trees
he
went
up
stairs
again
come
he
said
to
cosette
he
took
her
by
the
hand
and
they
both
went
out

an
observation
here
becomes
necessary
in
view
of
the
pages
which
the
reader
is
about
to
peruse
and
of
others
which
will
be
met
with
further
on
the
author
of
this
book
who
regrets
the
necessity
of
mentioning
himself
has
been
absent
from
paris
for
many
years
paris
has
been
transformed
since
he
quitted
it
a
new
city
has
arisen
which
is
after
a
fashion
unknown
to
him
there
is
no
need
for
him
to
say
that
he
loves
paris
paris
is
his
mind
s
natal
city
in
consequence
of
demolitions
and
reconstructions
the
paris
of
his
youth
that
paris
which
he
bore
away
religiously
in
his
memory
is
now
a
paris
of
days
gone
by
he
must
be
permitted
to
speak
of
that
paris
as
though
it
still
existed
it
is
possible
that
when
the
author
conducts
his
readers
to
a
spot
and
says
in
such
a
street
there
stands
such
and
such
a
house
neither
street
nor
house
will
any
longer
exist
in
that
locality
readers
may
verify
the
facts
if
they
care
to
take
the
trouble
for
his
own
part
he
is
unacquainted
with
the
new
paris
and
he
writes
with
the
old
paris
before
his
eyes
in
an
illusion
which
is
precious
to
him
it
is
a
delight
to
him
to
dream
that
there
still
lingers
behind
him
something
of
that
which
he
beheld
when
he
was
in
his
own
country
and
that
all
has
not
vanished
so
long
as
you
go
and
come
in
your
native
land
you
imagine
that
those
streets
are
a
matter
of
indifference
to
you
that
those
windows
those
roofs
and
those
doors
are
nothing
to
you
that
those
walls
are
strangers
to
you
that
those
trees
are
merely
the
first
encountered
haphazard
that
those
houses
which
you
do
not
enter
are
useless
to
you
that
the
pavements
which
you
tread
are
merely
stones
later
on
when
you
are
no
longer
there
you
perceive
that
the
streets
are
dear
to
you
that
you
miss
those
roofs
those
doors
and
that
those
walls
are
necessary
to
you
those
trees
are
well
beloved
by
you
that
you
entered
those
houses
which
you
never
entered
every
day
and
that
you
have
left
a
part
of
your
heart
of
your
blood
of
your
soul
in
those
pavements
all
those
places
which
you
no
longer
behold
which
you
may
never
behold
again
perchance
and
whose
memory
you
have
cherished
take
on
a
melancholy
charm
recur
to
your
mind
with
the
melancholy
of
an
apparition
make
the
holy
land
visible
to
you
and
are
so
to
speak
the
very
form
of
france
and
you
love
them
and
you
call
them
up
as
they
are
as
they
were
and
you
persist
in
this
and
you
will
submit
to
no
change
for
you
are
attached
to
the
figure
of
your
fatherland
as
to
the
face
of
your
mother
may
we
then
be
permitted
to
speak
of
the
past
in
the
present
that
said
we
beg
the
reader
to
take
note
of
it
and
we
continue
jean
valjean
instantly
quitted
the
boulevard
and
plunged
into
the
streets
taking
the
most
intricate
lines
which
he
could
devise
returning
on
his
track
at
times
to
make
sure
that
he
was
not
being
followed
the
black
hunt
this
manoeuvre
is
peculiar
to
the
hunted
stag
on
soil
where
an
imprint
of
the
track
may
be
left
this
manoeuvre
possesses
among
other
advantages
that
of
deceiving
the
huntsmen
and
the
dogs
by
throwing
them
on
the
wrong
scent
in
venery
this
is
called
false
re
imbushment
the
moon
was
full
that
night
jean
valjean
was
not
sorry
for
this
the
moon
still
very
close
to
the
horizon
cast
great
masses
of
light
and
shadow
in
the
streets
jean
valjean
could
glide
along
close
to
the
houses
on
the
dark
side
and
yet
keep
watch
on
the
light
side
he
did
not
perhaps
take
sufficiently
into
consideration
the
fact
that
the
dark
side
escaped
him
still
in
the
deserted
lanes
which
lie
near
the
rue
poliveau
he
thought
he
felt
certain
that
no
one
was
following
him
cosette
walked
on
without
asking
any
questions
the
sufferings
of
the
first
six
years
of
her
life
had
instilled
something
passive
into
her
nature
moreover
and
this
is
a
remark
to
which
we
shall
frequently
have
occasion
to
recur
she
had
grown
used
without
being
herself
aware
of
it
to
the
peculiarities
of
this
good
man
and
to
the
freaks
of
destiny
and
then
she
was
with
him
and
she
felt
safe
jean
valjean
knew
no
more
where
he
was
going
than
did
cosette
he
trusted
in
god
as
she
trusted
in
him
it
seemed
as
though
he
also
were
clinging
to
the
hand
of
some
one
greater
than
himself
he
thought
he
felt
a
being
leading
him
though
invisible
however
he
had
no
settled
idea
no
plan
no
project
he
was
not
even
absolutely
sure
that
it
was
javert
and
then
it
might
have
been
javert
without
javert
knowing
that
he
was
jean
valjean
was
not
he
disguised
was
not
he
believed
to
be
dead
still
queer
things
had
been
going
on
for
several
days
he
wanted
no
more
of
them
he
was
determined
not
to
return
to
the
gorbeau
house
like
the
wild
animal
chased
from
its
lair
he
was
seeking
a
hole
in
which
he
might
hide
until
he
could
find
one
where
he
might
dwell
jean
valjean
described
many
and
varied
labyrinths
in
the
mouffetard
quarter
which
was
already
asleep
as
though
the
discipline
of
the
middle
ages
and
the
yoke
of
the
curfew
still
existed
he
combined
in
various
manners
with
cunning
strategy
the
rue
censier
and
the
rue
copeau
the
rue
du
battoir
saint
victor
and
the
rue
du
puits
l
ermite
there
are
lodging
houses
in
this
locality
but
he
did
not
even
enter
one
finding
nothing
which
suited
him
he
had
no
doubt
that
if
any
one
had
chanced
to
be
upon
his
track
they
would
have
lost
it
as
eleven
o
clock
struck
from
saint
etienne
du
mont
he
was
traversing
the
rue
de
pontoise
in
front
of
the
office
of
the
commissary
of
police
situated
at
no
14
a
few
moments
later
the
instinct
of
which
we
have
spoken
above
made
him
turn
round
at
that
moment
he
saw
distinctly
thanks
to
the
commissary
s
lantern
which
betrayed
them
three
men
who
were
following
him
closely
pass
one
after
the
other
under
that
lantern
on
the
dark
side
of
the
street
one
of
the
three
entered
the
alley
leading
to
the
commissary
s
house
the
one
who
marched
at
their
head
struck
him
as
decidedly
suspicious
come
child
he
said
to
cosette
and
he
made
haste
to
quit
the
rue
pontoise
he
took
a
circuit
turned
into
the
passage
des
patriarches
which
was
closed
on
account
of
the
hour
strode
along
the
rue
de
l
epee
de
bois
and
the
rue
de
l
arbalete
and
plunged
into
the
rue
des
postes
at
that
time
there
was
a
square
formed
by
the
intersection
of
streets
where
the
college
rollin
stands
to
day
and
where
the
rue
neuve
sainte
genevieve
turns
off
it
is
understood
of
course
that
the
rue
neuve
sainte
genevieve
is
an
old

the
moon
cast
a
livid
light
into
this
open
space
jean
valjean
went
into
ambush
in
a
doorway
calculating
that
if
the
men
were
still
following
him
he
could
not
fail
to
get
a
good
look
at
them
as
they
traversed
this
illuminated
space
in
point
of
fact
three
minutes
had
not
elapsed
when
the
men
made
their
appearance
there
were
four
of
them
now
all
were
tall
dressed
in
long
brown
coats
with
round
hats
and
huge
cudgels
in
their
hands
their
great
stature
and
their
vast
fists
rendered
them
no
less
alarming
than
did
their
sinister
stride
through
the
darkness
one
would
have
pronounced
them
four
spectres
disguised
as
bourgeois
they
halted
in
the
middle
of
the
space
and
formed
a
group
like
men
in
consultation
they
had
an
air
of
indecision
the
one
who
appeared
to
be
their
leader
turned
round
and
pointed
hastily
with
his
right
hand
in
the
direction
which
jean
valjean
had
taken
another
seemed
to
indicate
the
contrary
direction
with
considerable
obstinacy
at
the
moment
when
the

wheeled
round

uncertainty
was
at
an
end
for
jean
valjean
fortunately
it
still
lasted
for
the
men
he
took
advantage
of
their
hesitation
it
was
time
lost
for
them
but
gained
for
him
he
slipped
from
under
the
gate
where
he
had
concealed
himself
and
went
down
the
rue
des
postes
towards
the
region
of
the
jardin

cosette
was
beginning
to
be
tired
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
there
were
no
passers
by
and
the
street
lanterns
had
not
been
lighted
on
account
of
there
being
a
moon
he
redoubled
his
pace
in
a
few
strides
he
had
reached
the
goblet

on
the
front
of
which
the

rendered
distinctly

him

then
the

skirted
the

by
the

and
reached
the
quay
there
he
turned
round
the

was
deserted
the
streets
were
deserted
there
was
no
one
behind
him
he
drew
a
long
breath
he
gained
the

tolls
were
still
collected
there
at
that

he
presented
himself
at

vexed
that

a
heavy

was
crossing
the
seine
at
the
same
time
as
himself
and
on
its
way
like
him
to
the
right
bank
this
was
of
use
to
him
he
could
traverse
the
bridge
in
the
shadow
of
the
cart
towards
the
middle
of
the
bridge
cosette
whose
feet
were
benumbed
wanted
to

he
set
her
on
the
ground
and
took
her

again
the

once
crossed
he
perceived
some
timber
yards
on
his
right
he
directed
his
course
thither
in
order
to
reach
them
it
was
necessary
to
risk
himself
in
a
tolerably
large
unsheltered
and
illuminated
space
he
did
not
hesitate
those
who
were
on
his
track
had
evidently
lost
the
scent
and

believed
himself
to

little
street
the

opened

timber
yards
enclosed
in
walls
this
street
was
dark
and
narrow
and
seemed
made
expressly
for
him
before
entering
it
he
cast
a
glance
behind
him
from
the
point
where
he
stood
he
could
see
the
whole
extent
of
the
pont

four
shadows
were
just
entering
on
the
bridge
these
shadows
had
their
backs
turned
to

were
on

to

these

were
the
four

jean
valjean
shuddered
like
the
wild
beast
which
is
recaptured
one
hope
remained
to
him
it
was
that
the
men
had
not
perhaps
stepped
on
the
bridge
and
had
not
caught
sight
of
him
while
he
was
crossing
the

into

reach
the
timber
yards
the
marshes
the
market
gardens
the
uninhabited
ground
which
was
not

upon

seemed
to
him
that

three
hundred
paces
further
on
he
arrived
at
a
point
where
the
street
forked
it
separated
into
two
streets
which
ran
in
a
slanting
line
one
to
the
right
and
the
other
to
the
left
jean
valjean
had
before
him
what
resembled
the
two
branches
of
a
y
which
should
he
choose
he
did
not
hesitate
but
took
the
one
on
the
right
why
because
that
to
the
left
ran
towards
a
suburb
that
is
to
say
towards
inhabited
regions
and
the
right
branch
towards
the
open
country
that
is
to
say
towards
deserted
regions
however
they
no
longer
walked
very
fast
cosette
s
pace
retarded
jean
valjean
s
he
took
her
up
and
carried
her
again
cosette
laid
her
head
on
the
shoulder
of
the
good
man
and
said
not
a
word
he
turned
round
from
time
to
time
and
looked
behind
him
he
took
care
to
keep
always
on
the
dark
side
of
the
street
the
street
was
straight
in
his
rear
the
first
two
or
three
times
that
he
turned
round
he
saw
nothing
the
silence
was
profound
and
he
continued
his
march
somewhat
reassured
all
at
once
on
turning
round
he
thought
he
perceived
in
the
portion
of
the
street
which
he
had
just
passed
through
far
off
in
the
obscurity
something
which
was
moving
he
rushed
forward
precipitately
rather
than
walked
hoping
to
find
some
side
street
to
make
his
escape
through
it
and
thus
to
break
his
scent
once
more
he
arrived
at
a
wall
this
wall
however
did
not
absolutely
prevent
further
progress
it
was
a
wall
which
bordered
a
transverse
street
in
which
the
one
he
had
taken
ended
here
again
he
was
obliged
to
come
to
a
decision
should
he
go
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
he
glanced
to
the
right
the
fragmentary
lane
was
prolonged
between
buildings
which
were
either
sheds
or
barns
then
ended
at
a
blind
alley
the
extremity
of
the
cul
de
sac
was
distinctly
visible
a
lofty
white
wall
he
glanced
to
the
left
on
that
side
the
lane
was
open
and
about
two
hundred
paces
further
on
ran
into
a
street
of
which
it
was
the
affluent
on
that
side
lay
safety
at
the
moment
when
jean
valjean
was
meditating
a
turn
to
the
left
in
an
effort
to
reach
the
street
which
he
saw
at
the
end
of
the
lane
he
perceived
a
sort
of
motionless
black
statue
at
the
corner
of
the
lane
and
the
street
towards
which
he
was
on
the
point
of
directing
his
steps
it
was
some
one
a
man
who
had
evidently
just
been
posted
there
and
who
was
barring
the
passage
and
waiting
jean
valjean
recoiled
the
point
of
paris
where
jean
valjean
found
himself
situated
between
the
faubourg
saint
antoine
and
la
rapee
is
one
of
those
which
recent
improvements
have
transformed
from
top
to
bottom
resulting
in
disfigurement
according
to
some
and
in
a
transfiguration
according
to
others
the
market

the
timber
yards
and
the
old
buildings
have
been
effaced
to
day
there
are

the
reader
sees
with
its
antidote

a

tongue

compounded
of
traditions
which
persists
in
calling

which
moreover
hardly
ever
had
any
existence
and
never
was
more
than
the
outline
of
a
quarter
had
nearly
the
monkish
aspect
of
a
spanish
town
the
roads
were
not
much
paved
the
streets
were
not
much
built
up
with
the
exception
of
the
two
or
three
streets
of
which
we
shall
presently
speak
all
was

had
as
we
have
just
mentioned
a
y
of
streets
formed
by
the
rue
du
chemin
vert

which
spread
out
in
two
branches
taking
on
the
left
the
name
of
little
picpus
street
and
on
the
right
the
name
of
the
rue
polonceau
the
two
limbs
of
the
y
were
connected
at
the
apex
as
by
a
bar
this
bar
was
called
rue
droit
mur
the
rue
polonceau
ended
there
rue
petit
picpus
passed
on
and
ascended
towards
the
lenoir
market
a
person
coming
from
the
seine
reached
the
extremity
of
the
rue
polonceau
and
had
on
his
right
the
rue
droit
mur
turning
abruptly
at
a
right
angle
in
front
of
him
the
wall
of
that
street
and
on
his
right
a
truncated
prolongation
of
the
rue
droit
mur
which
had
no
issue
and
was
called
the
cul
de
sac
genrot
it
was
here
that
jean
valjean
stood
as
we
have
just
said
on
catching
sight
of
that
black
silhouette
standing
on
guard
at
the
angle
of
the
rue
droit
mur
and
the
rue
petit
picpus
he
recoiled
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
that
phantom
was
lying
in
wait
for
him
what
was
he
to
do
the
time
for
retreating
was
passed
that
which
he
had
perceived
in
movement
an
instant
before
in
the
distant
darkness
was
javert
and
his
squad
without
a
doubt
javert
was
probably
already
at
the
commencement
of
the
street
at
whose
end
jean
valjean
stood
javert
to
all
appearances
was
acquainted
with
this
little
labyrinth
and
had
taken
his
precautions
by
sending
one
of
his
men
to
guard
the
exit
these
surmises
which
so
closely
resembled
proofs
whirled
suddenly
like
a
handful
of
dust
caught
up
by
an
unexpected
gust
of
wind
through
jean
valjean
s
mournful
brain
he
examined
the
cul
de
sac
genrot
there
he
was
cut
off
he
examined
the
rue
petit
picpus
there
stood
a
sentinel
he
saw
that
black
form
standing
out
in
relief
against
the
white
pavement
illuminated
by
the
moon
to
advance
was
to
fall
into
this
man
s
hands
to
retreat
was
to
fling
himself
into
javert
s
arms
jean
valjean
felt
himself
caught
as
in
a
net
which
was
slowly
contracting
he
gazed
heavenward
in
despair
chapter
iv
the
gropings
of

in
order
to
understand
what
follows
it
is
requisite
to
form
an
exact
idea
of
the
droit
mur
lane
and
in
particular
of
the
angle
which
one
leaves
on
the
left
when
one
emerges
from
the
rue
polonceau
into
this
lane
droit
mur
lane
was
almost
entirely
bordered
on
the
right
as
far
as
the
rue
petit
picpus
by
houses
of
mean
aspect
on
the
left
by
a
solitary
building
of
severe
outlines
composed
of
numerous
parts
which
grew
gradually
higher
by
a
story
or
two
as
they
approached
the
rue
petit
picpus
side
so
that
this
building
which
was
very
lofty
on
the
rue
petit
picpus
side
was
tolerably
low
on
the
side
adjoining
the
rue
polonceau
there
at
the
angle
of
which
we
have
spoken
it
descended
to
such
a
degree
that
it
consisted
of
merely
a
wall
this
wall
did
not
abut
directly
on
the
street
it
formed
a
deeply
retreating
niche
concealed
by
its
two
corners
from
two
observers
who
might
have
been
one
in
the
rue
polonceau
the
other
in
the
rue
droit
mur
beginning
with
these
angles
of
the
niche
the
wall
extended
along
the
rue
polonceau
as
far
as
a
house
which
bore
the
number
49
and
along
the
rue
droit
mur
where
the
fragment
was
much
shorter
as
far
as
the
gloomy
building
which
we
have
mentioned
and
whose
gable
it
intersected
thus
forming
another
retreating
angle
in
the
street
this
gable
was
sombre
of
aspect
only
one
window
was
visible
or
to
speak
more
correctly
two
shutters
covered
with
a
sheet
of
zinc
and
kept
constantly
closed
the
state
of
the
places
of
which
we
are
here
giving
a
description
is
rigorously
exact
and
will
certainly
awaken
a
very
precise
memory
in
the
mind
of
old
inhabitants
of
the
quarter
the
niche
was
entirely
filled
by
a
thing
which
resembled
a
colossal
and
wretched
door
it
was
a
vast
formless
assemblage
of
perpendicular
planks
the
upper
ones
being
broader
than
the
lower
bound
together
by
long
transverse
strips
of
iron
at
one
side
there
was
a
carriage
gate
of
the
ordinary
dimensions
and
which
had
evidently
not
been
cut
more
than
fifty
years
previously
a
linden
tree
showed
its
crest
above
the
niche
and
the
wall
was
covered
with
ivy
on
the
side
of
the
rue
polonceau
in
the
imminent
peril
in
which
jean
valjean
found
himself
this
sombre
building
had
about
it
a
solitary
and
uninhabited
look
which
tempted
him
he
ran
his
eyes
rapidly
over
it
he
said
to
himself
that
if
he
could
contrive
to
get
inside
it
he
might
save
himself
first
he
conceived
an
idea
then
a
hope
in
the
central
portion
of
the
front
of
this
building
on
the
rue
droit
mur
side
there
were
at
all
the
windows
of
the
different
stories
ancient
cistern
pipes
of
lead
the
various
branches
of
the
pipes
which
led
from
one
central
pipe
to
all
these
little
basins
sketched
out
a
sort
of
tree
on
the
front
these
ramifications
of
pipes
with
their
hundred
elbows
imitated
those
old
leafless
vine
stocks
which
writhe
over
the
fronts
of
old
farm
houses
this
odd
espalier
with
its
branches
of
lead
and
iron
was
the
first
thing
that
struck
jean
valjean
he
seated
cosette
with
her
back
against
a
stone
post
with
an
injunction
to
be
silent
and
ran
to
the
spot
where
the
conduit
touched
the
pavement
perhaps
there
was
some
way
of
climbing
up
by
it
and
entering
the
house
but
the
pipe
was
dilapidated
and
past
service
and
hardly
hung
to
its
fastenings
moreover
all
the
windows
of
this
silent
dwelling
were
grated
with
heavy
iron
bars
even
the
attic
windows
in
the
roof
and
then
the
moon
fell
full
upon
that
facade
and
the
man
who
was
watching
at
the
corner
of
the
street
would
have
seen
jean
valjean
in
the
act
of
climbing
and
finally
what
was
to
be
done
with
cosette
how
was
she
to
be
drawn
up
to
the
top
of
a
three
story
house
he
gave
up
all
idea
of
climbing
by
means
of
the
drain
pipe
and
crawled
along
the
wall
to
get
back
into
the
rue
polonceau
when
he
reached
the
slant
of
the
wall
where
he
had
left
cosette
he
noticed
that
no
one
could
see
him
there
as
we
have
just
explained
he
was
concealed
from
all
eyes
no
matter
from
which
direction
they
were
approaching
besides
this
he
was
in
the
shadow
finally
there
were
two
doors
perhaps
they
might
be
forced
the
wall
above
which
he
saw
the
linden
tree
and
the
ivy
evidently
abutted
on
a
garden
where
he
could
at
least
hide
himself
although
there
were
as
yet
no
leaves
on
the
trees
and
spend
the
remainder
of
the
night
time
was
passing
he
must
act
quickly
he
felt
over
the
carriage
door
and
immediately
recognized
the
fact
that
it
was
impracticable
outside
and
in
he
approached
the
other
door
with
more
hope
it
was
frightfully
decrepit
its
very
immensity
rendered
it
less
solid
the
planks
were
rotten
the
iron
bands
there
were
only
three
of
them
were
rusted
it
seemed
as
though
it
might
be
possible
to
pierce
this
worm
eaten
barrier
on
examining
it
he
found
that
the
door
was
not
a
door
it
had
neither
hinges
cross
bars
lock
nor
fissure
in
the
middle
the
iron
bands
traversed
it
from
side
to
side
without
any
break
through
the
crevices
in
the
planks
he
caught
a
view
of
unhewn
slabs
and
blocks
of
stone
roughly
cemented
together
which
passers
by
might
still
have
seen
there
ten
years
ago
he
was
forced
to
acknowledge
with
consternation
that
this
apparent
door
was
simply
the
wooden
decoration
of
a
building
against
which
it
was
placed
it
was
easy
to
tear
off
a
plank
but
then
one
found
one
s
self
face
to
face
with
a
wall
chapter
v
which
would
be
impossible
with
gas
lanterns
at
that
moment
a
heavy
and
measured
sound
began
to
be
audible
at
some
distance
jean
valjean
risked
a
glance
round
the
corner
of
the
street
seven
or
eight
soldiers
drawn
up
in
a
platoon
had
just
debouched
into
the
rue
polonceau
he
saw
the
gleam
of
their
bayonets
they
were
advancing
towards
him
these
soldiers
at
whose
head
he
distinguished
javert
s
tall
figure
advanced
slowly
and
cautiously
they
halted
frequently
it
was
plain
that
they
were
searching
all
the
nooks
of
the
walls
and
all
the
embrasures
of
the
doors
and
alleys
this
was
some
patrol
that
javert
had
encountered
there
could
be
no
mistake
as
to
this
surmise
and
whose
aid
he
had
demanded
javert
s
two
acolytes
were
marching
in
their
ranks
at
the
rate
at
which
they
were
marching
and
in
consideration
of
the
halts
which
they
were
making
it
would
take
them
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
reach
the
spot
where
jean
valjean
stood
it
was
a
frightful
moment
a
few
minutes
only
separated
jean
valjean
from
that
terrible
precipice
which
yawned
before
him
for
the
third
time
and
the
galleys
now
meant
not
only
the
galleys
but
cosette
lost
to
him
forever
that
is
to
say
a
life
resembling
the
interior
of
a
tomb
there
was
but
one
thing
which
was
possible
jean
valjean
had
this
peculiarity
that
he
carried
as
one
might
say
two
beggar
s
pouches
in
one
he
kept
his
saintly
thoughts
in
the
other
the
redoubtable
talents
of
a
convict
he
rummaged
in
the
one
or
the
other
according
to
circumstances
among
his
other
resources
thanks
to
his
numerous
escapes
from
the
prison
at
toulon
he
was
as
it
will
be
remembered
a
past
master
in
the
incredible
art
of
crawling
up
without
ladder
or
climbing
irons
by
sheer
muscular
force
by
leaning
on
the
nape
of
his
neck
his
shoulders
his
hips
and
his
knees
by
helping
himself
on
the
rare
projections
of
the
stone
in
the
right
angle
of
a
wall
as
high
as
the
sixth
story
if
need
be
an
art
which
has
rendered
so
celebrated
and
so
alarming
that
corner
of
the
wall
of
the
conciergerie
of
paris
by
which
battemolle
condemned
to
death
made
his
escape
twenty
years
ago
jean
valjean
measured
with
his
eyes
the
wall
above
which
he
espied
the
linden
it
was
about
eighteen
feet
in
height
the
angle
which
it
formed
with
the
gable
of
the
large
building
was
filled
at
its
lower
extremity
by
a
mass
of
masonry
of
a
triangular
shape
probably
intended
to
preserve
that
too
convenient
corner
from
the
rubbish
of
those
dirty
creatures
called
the
passers
by
this
practice
of
filling
up
corners
of
the
wall
is
much
in
use
in
paris
this
mass
was
about
five
feet
in
height
the
space
above
the
summit
of
this
mass
which
it
was
necessary
to
climb
was
not
more
than
fourteen
feet
the
wall
was
surmounted
by
a
flat
stone
without
a
coping
cosette
was
the
difficulty
for
she
did
not
know
how
to
climb
a
wall
should
he
abandon
her
jean
valjean
did
not
once
think
of
that
it
was
impossible
to
carry
her
a
man
s
whole
strength
is
required
to
successfully
carry
out
these
singular
ascents
the
least
burden
would
disturb
his
centre
of
gravity
and
pull
him
downwards
a
rope
would
have
been
required
jean
valjean
had
none
where
was
he
to
get
a
rope
at
midnight
in
the
rue
polonceau
certainly
if
jean
valjean
had
had
a
kingdom
he
would
have
given
it
for
a
rope
at
that
moment
all
extreme
situations
have
their
lightning
flashes
which
sometimes
dazzle
sometimes
illuminate
us
jean
valjean
s
despairing
glance
fell
on
the
street
lantern
post
of
the
blind
alley
genrot
at
that
epoch
there
were
no
gas
jets
in
the
streets
of
paris
at
nightfall
lanterns
placed
at
regular
distances
were
lighted
they
were
ascended
and
descended
by
means
of
a
rope
which
traversed
the
street
from
side
to
side
and
was
adjusted
in
a
groove
of
the
post
the
pulley
over
which
this
rope
ran
was
fastened
underneath
the
lantern
in
a
little
iron
box
the
key
to
which
was
kept
by
the
lamp
lighter
and
the
rope
itself
was
protected
by
a
metal
case
jean
valjean
with
the
energy
of
a
supreme
struggle
crossed
the
street
at
one
bound
entered
the
blind
alley
broke
the
latch
of
the
little
box
with
the
point
of
his
knife
and
an
instant
later
he
was
beside
cosette
once
more
he
had
a
rope
these
gloomy
inventors
of
expedients
work
rapidly
when
they
are
fighting
against
fatality
we
have
already
explained
that
the
lanterns
had
not
been
lighted
that
night
the
lantern
in
the
cul
de
sac
genrot
was
thus
naturally
extinct
like
the
rest
and
one
could
pass
directly
under
it
without
even
noticing
that
it
was
no
longer
in
its
place
nevertheless
the
hour
the
place
the
darkness
jean
valjean
s
absorption
his
singular
gestures
his
goings
and
comings
all
had
begun
to
render
cosette
uneasy
any
other
child
than
she
would
have
given
vent
to
loud
shrieks
long
before
she
contented
herself
with
plucking
jean
valjean
by
the
skirt
of
his
coat
they
could
hear
the
sound
of
the
patrol
s
approach
ever
more
and
more
distinctly
father
said
she
in
a
very
low
voice
i
am
afraid
who
is
coming
yonder
hush
replied
the
unhappy
man
it
is
madame
thenardier
cosette
shuddered
he
added
say
nothing
don
t
interfere
with
me
if
you
cry
out
if
you
weep
the
thenardier
is
lying
in
wait
for
you
she
is
coming
to
take
you
back
then
without
haste
but
without
making
a
useless
movement
with
firm
and
curt
precision
the
more
remarkable
at
a
moment
when
the
patrol
and
javert
might
come
upon
him
at
any
moment
he
undid
his
cravat
passed
it
round
cosette
s
body
under
the
armpits
taking
care
that
it
should
not
hurt
the
child
fastened
this
cravat
to
one
end
of
the
rope
by
means
of
that
knot
which
seafaring
men
call
a
swallow
knot
took
the
other
end
of
the
rope
in
his
teeth
pulled
off
his
shoes
and
stockings
which
he
threw
over
the
wall
stepped
upon
the
mass
of
masonry
and
began
to
raise
himself
in
the
angle
of
the
wall
and
the
gable
with
as
much
solidity
and
certainty
as
though
he
had
the
rounds
of
a
ladder
under
his
feet
and
elbows
half
a
minute
had
not
elapsed
when
he
was
resting
on
his
knees
on
the
wall
cosette
gazed
at
him
in
stupid
amazement
without
uttering
a
word
jean
valjean
s
injunction
and
the
name
of
madame
thenardier
had
chilled
her
blood
all
at
once
she
heard
jean
valjean
s
voice
crying
to
her
though
in
a
very
low
tone
put
your
back
against
the
wall
she
obeyed
don
t
say
a
word
and
don
t
be
alarmed
went
on
jean
valjean
and
she
felt
herself
lifted
from
the
ground
before
she
had
time
to
recover
herself
she
was
on
the
top
of
the
wall
jean
valjean
grasped
her
put
her
on
his
back
took
her
two
tiny
hands
in
his
large
left
hand
lay
down
flat
on
his
stomach
and
crawled
along
on
top
of
the
wall
as
far
as
the
cant
as
he
had
guessed
there
stood
a
building
whose
roof
started
from
the
top
of
the
wooden
barricade
and
descended
to
within
a
very
short
distance
of
the
ground
with
a
gentle
slope
which
grazed
the
linden
tree
a
lucky
circumstance
for
the
wall
was
much
higher
on
this
side
than
on
the
street
side
jean
valjean
could
only
see
the
ground
at
a
great
depth
below
him
he
had
just
reached
the
slope
of
the
roof
and
had
not
yet
left
the
crest
of
the
wall
when
a
violent
uproar
announced
the
arrival
of
the
patrol
the
thundering
voice
of
javert
was
audible
search
the
blind
alley
the
rue
droit
mur
is
guarded
so
is
the
rue
petit
picpus
i
ll
answer
for
it
that
he
is
in
the
blind
alley
the
soldiers
rushed
into
the
genrot
alley
jean
valjean
allowed
himself
to
slide
down
the
roof
still
holding
fast
to
cosette
reached
the
linden
tree
and
leaped
to
the
ground
whether
from
terror
or
courage
cosette
had
not
breathed
a
sound
though
her
hands
were
a
little
abraded
chapter
vi
the
beginning
of
an
enigma
jean
valjean
found
himself
in
a
sort
of
garden
which
was
very
vast
and
of
singular
aspect
one
of
those
melancholy
gardens
which
seem
made
to
be
looked
at
in
winter
and
at
night
this
garden
was
oblong
in
shape
with
an
alley
of
large
poplars
at
the
further
end
tolerably
tall
forest
trees
in
the
corners
and
an
unshaded
space
in
the
centre
where
could
be
seen
a
very
large
solitary
tree
then
several
fruit
trees
gnarled
and
bristling
like
bushes
beds
of
vegetables
a
melon
patch
whose
glass
frames
sparkled
in
the
moonlight
and
an
old
well
here
and
there
stood
stone
benches
which
seemed
black
with
moss
the
alleys
were
bordered
with
gloomy
and
very
erect
little
shrubs
the
grass
had
half
taken
possession
of
them
and
a
green
mould
covered
the
rest
jean
valjean
had
beside
him
the
building
whose
roof
had
served
him
as
a
means
of
descent
a
pile
of
fagots
and
behind
the
fagots
directly
against
the
wall
a
stone
statue
whose
mutilated
face
was
no
longer
anything
more
than
a
shapeless
mask
which
loomed
vaguely
through
the
gloom
the
building
was
a
sort
of
ruin
where
dismantled
chambers
were
distinguishable
one
of
which
much
encumbered
seemed
to
serve
as
a
shed
the
large
building
of
the
rue
droit
mur
which
had
a
wing
on
the
rue
petit
picpus
turned
two
facades
at
right
angles
towards
this
garden
these
interior
facades
were
even
more
tragic
than
the
exterior
all
the
windows
were
grated
not
a
gleam
of
light
was
visible
at
any
one
of
them
the
upper
story
had
scuttles
like
prisons
one
of
those
facades
cast
its
shadow
on
the
other
which
fell
over
the
garden
like
an
immense
black
pall
no
other
house
was
visible
the
bottom
of
the
garden
was
lost
in
mist
and
darkness
nevertheless
walls
could
be
confusedly
made
out
which
intersected
as
though
there
were
more
cultivated
land
beyond
and
the
low
roofs
of
the
rue
polonceau
nothing
more
wild
and
solitary
than
this
garden
could
be
imagined
there
was
no
one
in
it
which
was
quite
natural
in
view
of
the
hour
but
it
did
not
seem
as
though
this
spot
were
made
for
any
one
to
walk
in
even
in
broad
daylight
jean
valjean
s
first
care
had
been
to
get
hold
of
his
shoes
and
put
them
on
again
then
to
step
under
the
shed
with
cosette
a
man
who
is
fleeing
never
thinks
himself
sufficiently
hidden
the
child
whose
thoughts
were
still
on
the
thenardier
shared
his
instinct
for
withdrawing
from
sight
as
much
as
possible
cosette
trembled
and
pressed
close
to
him
they
heard
the
tumultuous
noise
of
the
patrol
searching
the
blind
alley
and
the
streets
the
blows
of
their
gun
stocks
against
the
stones
javert
s
appeals
to
the
police
spies
whom
he
had
posted
and
his
imprecations
mingled
with
words
which
could
not
be
distinguished
at
the
expiration
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
it
seemed
as
though
that
species
of
stormy
roar
were
becoming
more
distant
jean
valjean
held
his
breath
he
had
laid
his
hand
lightly
on
cosette
s
mouth
however
the
solitude
in
which
he
stood
was
so
strangely
calm
that
this
frightful
uproar
close
and
furious
as
it
was
did
not
disturb
him
by
so
much
as
the
shadow
of
a
misgiving
it
seemed
as
though
those
walls
had
been
built
of
the
deaf
stones
of
which
the
scriptures
speak
all
at
once
in
the
midst
of
this
profound
calm
a
fresh
sound
arose
a
sound
as
celestial
divine
ineffable
ravishing
as
the
other
had
been
horrible
it
was
a
hymn
which
issued
from
the
gloom
a
dazzling
burst
of
prayer
and
harmony
in
the
obscure
and
alarming
silence
of
the
night
women
s
voices
but
voices
composed
at
one
and
the
same
time
of
the
pure
accents
of
virgins
and
the
innocent
accents
of
children
voices
which
are
not
of
the
earth
and
which
resemble
those
that
the
newborn
infant
still
hears
and
which
the
dying
man
hears
already
this
song
proceeded
from
the
gloomy
edifice
which
towered
above
the
garden
at
the
moment
when
the
hubbub
of
demons
retreated
one
would
have
said
that
a
choir
of
angels
was
approaching
through
the
gloom
cosette
and
jean
valjean
fell
on
their
knees
they
knew
not
what
it
was
they
knew
not
where
they
were
but
both
of
them
the
man
and
the
child
the
penitent
and
the
innocent
felt
that
they
must
kneel
these
voices
had
this
strange
characteristic
that
they
did
not
prevent
the
building
from
seeming
to
be
deserted
it
was
a
supernatural
chant
in
an
uninhabited
house
while
these
voices
were
singing
jean
valjean
thought
of
nothing
he
no
longer
beheld
the
night
he
beheld
a
blue
sky
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
felt
those
wings
which
we
all
have
within
us
unfolding
the
song
died
away
it
may
have
lasted
a
long
time
jean
valjean
could
not
have
told
hours
of
ecstasy
are
never
more
than
a
moment
all
fell
silent
again
there
was
no
longer
anything
in
the
street
there
was
nothing
in
the
garden
that
which
had
menaced
that
which
had
reassured
him
all
had
vanished
the
breeze
swayed
a
few
dry
weeds
on
the
crest
of
the
wall
and
they
gave
out
a
faint
sweet
melancholy
sound
chapter
vii
continuation
of
the
enigma
the
night
wind
had
risen
which
indicated
that
it
must
be
between
one
and
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
poor
cosette
said
nothing
as
she
had
seated
herself
beside
him
and
leaned
her
head
against
him
jean
valjean
had
fancied
that
she
was
asleep
he
bent
down
and
looked
at
her
cosette
s
eyes
were
wide
open
and
her
thoughtful
air
pained
jean
valjean
she
was
still
trembling
are
you
sleepy
said
jean
valjean
i
am
very
cold
she
replied
a
moment
later
she
resumed
is
she
still
there
who
said
jean
valjean
madame
thenardier
jean
valjean
had
already
forgotten
the
means
which
he
had
employed
to
make
cosette
keep
silent
ah
said
he
she
is
gone
you
need
fear
nothing
further
the
child
sighed
as
though
a
load
had
been
lifted
from
her
breast
the
ground
was
damp
the
shed
open
on
all
sides
the
breeze
grew
more
keen
every
instant
the
goodman
took
off
his
coat
and
wrapped
it
round
cosette
are
you
less
cold
now
said
he
oh
yes
father
well
wait
for
me
a
moment
i
will
soon
be
back
he
quitted
the
ruin
and
crept
along
the
large
building
seeking
a
better
shelter
he
came
across
doors
but
they
were
closed
there
were
bars
at
all
the
windows
of
the
ground
floor
just
after
he
had
turned
the
inner
angle
of
the
edifice
he
observed
that
he
was
coming
to
some
arched
windows
where
he
perceived
a
light
he
stood
on
tiptoe
and
peeped
through
one
of
these
windows
they
all
opened
on
a
tolerably
vast
hall
paved
with
large
flagstones
cut
up
by
arcades
and
pillars
where
only
a
tiny
light
and
great
shadows
were
visible
the
light
came
from
a
taper
which
was
burning
in
one
corner
the
apartment
was
deserted
and
nothing
was
stirring
in
it
nevertheless
by
dint
of
gazing
intently
he
thought
he
perceived
on
the
ground
something
which
appeared
to
be
covered
with
a
winding
sheet
and
which
resembled
a
human
form
this
form
was
lying
face
downward
flat
on
the
pavement
with
the
arms
extended
in
the
form
of
a
cross
in
the
immobility
of
death
one
would
have
said
judging
from
a
sort
of
serpent
which
undulated
over
the
floor
that
this
sinister
form
had
a
rope
round
its
neck
the
whole
chamber
was
bathed
in
that
mist
of
places
which
are
sparely
illuminated
which
adds
to
horror
jean
valjean
often
said
afterwards
that
although
many
funereal
spectres
had
crossed
his
path
in
life
he
had
never
beheld
anything
more
blood
curdling
and
terrible
than
that
enigmatical
form
accomplishing
some
inexplicable
mystery
in
that
gloomy
place
and
beheld
thus
at
night
it
was
alarming
to
suppose
that
that
thing
was
perhaps
dead
and
still
more
alarming
to
think
that
it
was
perhaps
alive
he
had
the
courage
to
plaster
his
face
to
the
glass
and
to
watch
whether
the
thing
would
move
in
spite
of
his
remaining
thus
what
seemed
to
him
a
very
long
time
the
outstretched
form
made
no
movement
all
at
once
he
felt
himself
overpowered
by
an
inexpressible
terror
and
he
fled
he
began
to
run
towards
the
shed
not
daring
to
look
behind
him
it
seemed
to
him
that
if
he
turned
his
head
he
should
see
that
form
following
him
with
great
strides
and
waving
its
arms
he
reached
the
ruin
all
out
of
breath
his
knees
were
giving
way
beneath
him
the
perspiration
was
pouring
from
him
where
was
he
who
could
ever
have
imagined
anything
like
that
sort
of
sepulchre
in
the
midst
of
paris
what
was
this
strange
house
an
edifice
full
of
nocturnal
mystery
calling
to
souls
through
the
darkness
with
the
voice
of
angels
and
when
they
came
offering
them
abruptly
that
terrible
vision
promising
to
open
the
radiant
portals
of
heaven
and
then
opening
the
horrible
gates
of
the
tomb
and
it
actually
was
an
edifice
a
house
which
bore
a
number
on
the
street
it
was
not
a
dream
he
had
to
touch
the
stones
to
convince
himself
that
such
was
the
fact
cold
anxiety
uneasiness
the
emotions
of
the
night
had
given
him
a
genuine
fever
and
all
these
ideas
were
clashing
together
in
his
brain
he
stepped
up
to
cosette
she
was
asleep
chapter
viii
the
enigma
becomes
doubly
mysterious
the
child
had
laid
her
head
on
a
stone
and
fallen
asleep
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
began
to
think
little
by
little
as
he
gazed
at
her
he
grew
calm
and
regained
possession
of
his
freedom
of
mind
he
clearly
perceived
this
truth
the
foundation
of
his
life
henceforth
that
so
long
as
she
was
there
so
long
as
he
had
her
near
him
he
should
need
nothing
except
for
her
he
should
fear
nothing
except
for
her
he
was
not
even
conscious
that
he
was
very
cold
since
he
had
taken
off
his
coat
to
cover
her
nevertheless
athwart
this
revery
into
which
he
had
fallen
he
had
heard
for
some
time
a
peculiar
noise
it
was
like
the
tinkling
of
a
bell
this
sound
proceeded
from
the
garden
it
could
be
heard
distinctly
though
faintly
it
resembled
the
faint
vague
music
produced
by
the
bells
of
cattle
at
night
in
the
pastures
this
noise
made
valjean
turn
round
he
looked
and
saw
that
there
was
some
one
in
the
garden
a
being
resembling
a
man
was
walking
amid
the
bell
glasses
of
the
melon
beds
rising
stooping
halting
with
regular
movements
as
though
he
were
dragging
or
spreading
out
something
on
the
ground
this
person
appeared
to
limp
jean
valjean
shuddered
with
the
continual
tremor
of
the
unhappy
for
them
everything
is
hostile
and
suspicious
they
distrust
the
day
because
it
enables
people
to
see
them
and
the
night
because
it
aids
in
surprising
them
a
little
while
before
he
had
shivered
because
the
garden
was
deserted
and
now
he
shivered
because
there
was
some
one
there
he
fell
back
from
chimerical
terrors
to
real
terrors
he
said
to
himself
that
javert
and
the
spies
had
perhaps
not
taken
their
departure
that
they
had
no
doubt
left
people
on
the
watch
in
the
street
that
if
this
man
should
discover
him
in
the
garden
he
would
cry
out
for
help
against
thieves
and
deliver
him
up
he
took
the
sleeping
cosette
gently
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
behind
a
heap
of
old
furniture
which
was
out
of
use
in
the
most
remote
corner
of
the
shed
cosette
did
not
stir
from
that
point
he
scrutinized
the
appearance
of
the
being
in
the
melon
patch
the
strange
thing
about
it
was
that
the
sound
of
the
bell
followed
each
of
this
man
s
movements
when
the
man
approached
the
sound
approached
when
the
man
retreated
the
sound
retreated
if
he
made
any
hasty
gesture
a
tremolo
accompanied
the
gesture
when
he
halted
the
sound
ceased
it
appeared
evident
that
the
bell
was
attached
to
that
man
but
what
could
that
signify
who
was
this
man
who
had
a
bell
suspended
about
him
like
a
ram
or
an
ox
as
he
put
these
questions
to
himself
he
touched
cosette
s
hands
they
were
icy
cold
ah
good
god
he
cried
he
spoke
to
her
in
a
low
voice
cosette
she
did
not
open
her
eyes
he
shook
her
vigorously
she
did
not
wake
is
she
dead
he
said
to
himself
and
sprang
to
his
feet
quivering
from
head
to
foot
the
most
frightful
thoughts
rushed
pell
mell
through
his
mind
there
are
moments
when
hideous
surmises
assail
us
like
a
cohort
of
furies
and
violently
force
the
partitions
of
our
brains
when
those
we
love
are
in
question
our
prudence
invents
every
sort
of
madness
he
remembered
that
sleep
in
the
open
air
on
a
cold
night
may
be
fatal
cosette
was
pale
and
had
fallen
at
full
length
on
the
ground
at
his
feet
without
a
movement
he
listened
to
her
breathing
she
still
breathed
but
with
a
respiration
which
seemed
to
him
weak
and
on
the
point
of
extinction
how
was
he
to
warm
her
back
to
life
how
was
he
to
rouse
her
all
that
was
not
connected
with
this
vanished
from
his
thoughts
he
rushed
wildly
from
the
ruin
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
cosette
should
be
in
bed
and
beside
a
fire
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
chapter
ix
the
man
with
the
bell
he
walked
straight
up
to
the
man
whom
he
saw
in
the
garden
he
had
taken
in
his
hand
the
roll
of
silver
which
was
in
the
pocket
of
his
waistcoat
the
man
s
head
was
bent
down
and
he
did
not
see
him
approaching
in
a
few
strides
jean
valjean
stood
beside
him
jean
valjean
accosted
him
with
the
cry
one
hundred
francs
the
man
gave
a
start
and
raised
his
eyes
you
can
earn
a
hundred
francs
went
on
jean
valjean
if
you
will
grant
me
shelter
for
this
night
the
moon
shone
full
upon
jean
valjean
s
terrified
countenance
what
so
it
is
you
father
madeleine
said
the
man
that
name
thus
pronounced
at
that
obscure
hour
in
that
unknown
spot
by
that
strange
man
made
jean
valjean
start
back
he
had
expected
anything
but
that
the
person
who
thus
addressed
him
was
a
bent
and
lame
old
man
dressed
almost
like
a
peasant
who
wore
on
his
left
knee
a
leather
knee
cap
whence
hung
a
moderately
large
bell
his
face
which
was
in
the
shadow
was
not
distinguishable
however
the
goodman
had
removed
his
cap
and
exclaimed
trembling
all
over
ah
good
god
how
come
you
here
father
madeleine
where
did
you
enter
dieu
jesus
did
you
fall
from
heaven
there
is
no
trouble
about
that
if
ever
you
do
fall
it
will
be
from
there
and
what
a
state
you
are
in
you
have
no
cravat
you
have
no
hat
you
have
no
coat
do
you
know
you
would
have
frightened
any
one
who
did
not
know
you
no
coat
lord
god
are
the
saints
going
mad
nowadays
but
how
did
you
get
in
here
his
words
tumbled
over
each
other
the
goodman
talked
with
a
rustic
volubility
in
which
there
was
nothing
alarming
all
this
was
uttered
with
a
mixture
of
stupefaction
and
naive
kindliness
who
are
you
and
what
house
is
this
demanded
jean
valjean
ah
pardieu
this
is
too
much
exclaimed
the
old
man
i
am
the
person
for
whom
you
got
the
place
here
and
this
house
is
the
one
where
you
had
me
placed
what
you
don
t
recognize
me
no
said
jean
valjean
and
how
happens
it
that
you
know
me
you
saved
my
life
said
the
man
he
turned
a
ray
of
moonlight
outlined
his
profile
and
jean
valjean
recognized
old
fauchelevent
ah
said
jean
valjean
so
it
is
you
yes
i
recollect
you
that
is
very
lucky
said
the
old
man
in
a
reproachful
tone
and
what
are
you
doing
here
resumed
jean
valjean
why
i
am
covering
my
melons
of
course
in
fact
at
the
moment
when
jean
valjean
accosted
him
old
fauchelevent
held
in
his
hand
the
end
of
a
straw
mat
which
he
was
occupied
in
spreading
over
the
melon
bed
during
the
hour
or
thereabouts
that
he
had
been
in
the
garden
he
had
already
spread
out
a
number
of
them
it
was
this
operation
which
had
caused
him
to
execute
the
peculiar
movements
observed
from
the
shed
by
jean
valjean
he
continued
i
said
to
myself
the
moon
is
bright
it
is
going
to
freeze
what
if
i
were
to
put
my
melons
into
their
greatcoats
and
he
added
looking
at
jean
valjean
with
a
broad
smile
pardieu
you
ought
to
have
done
the
same
but
how
do
you
come
here
jean
valjean
finding
himself
known
to
this
man
at
least
only
under
the
name
of
madeleine
thenceforth
advanced
only
with
caution
he
multiplied
his
questions
strange
to
say
their
roles
seemed
to
be
reversed
it
was
he
the
intruder
who
interrogated
and
what
is
this
bell
which
you
wear
on
your
knee
this
replied
fauchelevent
is
so
that
i
may
be
avoided
what
so
that
you
may
be
avoided
old
fauchelevent
winked
with
an
indescribable
air
ah
goodness
there
are
only
women
in
this
house
many
young
girls
it
appears
that
i
should
be
a
dangerous
person
to
meet
the
bell
gives
them
warning
when
i
come
they
go
what
house
is
this
come
you
know
well
enough
but
i
do
not
not
when
you
got
me
the
place
here
as
gardener
answer
me
as
though
i
knew
nothing
well
then
this
is
the
petit
picpus
convent
memories
recurred
to
jean
valjean
chance
that
is
to
say
providence
had
cast
him
into
precisely
that
convent
in
the
quartier
saint
antoine
where
old
fauchelevent
crippled
by
the
fall
from
his
cart
had
been
admitted
on
his
recommendation
two
years
previously
he
repeated
as
though
talking
to
himself
the
petit
picpus
convent
exactly
returned
old
fauchelevent
but
to
come
to
the
point
how
the
deuce
did
you
manage
to
get
in
here
you
father
madeleine
no
matter
if
you
are
a
saint
you
are
a
man
as
well
and
no
man
enters
here
you
certainly
are
here
there
is
no
one
but
me
still
said
jean
valjean
i
must
stay
here
ah
good
god
cried
fauchelevent
jean
valjean
drew
near
to
the
old
man
and
said
to
him
in
a
grave
voice
father
fauchelevent
i
saved
your
life
i
was
the
first
to
recall
it
returned
fauchelevent
well
you
can
do
to
day
for
me
that
which
i
did
for
you
in
the
olden
days
fauchelevent
took
in
his
aged
trembling
and
wrinkled
hands
jean
valjean
s
two
robust
hands
and
stood
for
several
minutes
as
though
incapable
of
speaking
at
length
he
exclaimed
oh
that
would
be
a
blessing
from
the
good
god
if
i
could
make
you
some
little
return
for
that
save
your
life
monsieur
le
maire
dispose
of
the
old
man
a
wonderful
joy
had
transfigured
this
old
man
his
countenance
seemed
to
emit
a
ray
of
light
what
do
you
wish
me
to
do
he
resumed
that
i
will
explain
to
you
you
have
a
chamber
i
have
an
isolated
hovel
yonder
behind
the
ruins
of
the
old
convent
in
a
corner
which
no
one
ever
looks
into
there
are
three
rooms
in
it
the
hut
was
in
fact
so
well
hidden
behind
the
ruins
and
so
cleverly
arranged
to
prevent
it
being
seen
that
jean
valjean
had
not
perceived
it
good
said
jean
valjean
now
i
am
going
to
ask
two
things
of
you
what
are
they
mr
mayor
in
the
first
place
you
are
not
to
tell
any
one
what
you
know
about
me
in
the
second
you
are
not
to
try
to
find
out
anything
more
as
you
please
i
know
that
you
can
do
nothing
that
is
not
honest
that
you
have
always
been
a
man
after
the
good
god
s
heart
and
then
moreover
you
it
was
who
placed
me
here
that
concerns
you
i
am
at
your
service
that
is
settled
then
now
come
with
me
we
will
go
and
get
the
child
ah
said
fauchelevent
so
there
is
a
child
he
added
not
a
word
further
and
followed
jean
valjean
as
a
dog
follows
his
master
less
than
half
an
hour
afterwards
cosette
who
had
grown
rosy
again
before
the
flame
of
a
good
fire
was
lying
asleep
in
the
old
gardener
s
bed
jean
valjean
had
put
on
his
cravat
and
coat
once
more
his
hat
which
he
had
flung
over
the
wall
had
been
found
and
picked
up
while
jean
valjean
was
putting
on
his
coat
fauchelevent
had
removed
the
bell
and
kneecap
which
now
hung
on
a
nail
beside
a
vintage
basket
that
adorned
the
wall
the
two
men
were
warming
themselves
with
their
elbows
resting
on
a
table
upon
which
fauchelevent
had
placed
a
bit
of
cheese
black
bread
a
bottle
of
wine
and
two
glasses
and
the
old
man
was
saying
to
jean
valjean
as
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
latter
s
knee
ah
father
madeleine
you
did
not
recognize
me
immediately
you
save
people
s
lives
and
then
you
forget
them
that
is
bad
but
they
remember
you
you
are
an
ingrate
chapter
x
which
explains
how
javert
got
on
the
scent
the
events
of
which
we
have
just
beheld
the
reverse
side
so
to
speak
had
come
about
in
the
simplest
possible
manner
when
jean
valjean
on
the
evening
of
the
very
day
when
javert
had
arrested
him
beside
fantine
s
death
bed
had
escaped
from
the
town
jail
of
m
sur
m
the
police
had
supposed
that
he
had
betaken
himself
to
paris
paris
is
a
maelstrom
where
everything
is
lost
and
everything
disappears
in
this
belly
of
the
world
as
in
the
belly
of
the
sea
no
forest
hides
a
man
as
does
that
crowd
fugitives
of
every
sort
know
this
they
go
to
paris
as
to
an
abyss
there
are
gulfs
which
save
the
police
know
it
also
and
it
is
in
paris
that
they
seek
what
they
have
lost
elsewhere
they
sought
the
ex
mayor
of
m
sur
m
javert
was
summoned
to
paris
to
throw
light
on
their
researches
javert
had
in
fact
rendered
powerful
assistance
in
the
recapture
of
jean
valjean
javert
s
zeal
and
intelligence
on
that
occasion
had
been
remarked
by
m
chabouillet
secretary
of
the
prefecture
under
comte
angles
m
chabouillet
who
had
moreover
already
been
javert
s
patron
had
the
inspector
of
m
sur
m
attached
to
the
police
force
of
paris
there
javert
rendered
himself
useful
in
divers
and
though
the
word
may
seem
strange
for
such
services
honorable
manners
he
no
longer
thought
of
jean
valjean
the
wolf
of
to
day
causes
these
dogs
who
are
always
on
the
chase
to
forget
the
wolf
of
yesterday
when
in
december
1823
he
read
a
newspaper
he
who
never
read
newspapers
but
javert
a
monarchical
man
had
a
desire
to
know
the
particulars
of
the
triumphal
entry
of
the
prince
generalissimo
into
bayonne
just
as
he
was
finishing
the
article
which
interested
him
a
name
the
name
of
jean
valjean
attracted
his
attention
at
the
bottom
of
a
page
the
paper
announced
that
the
convict
jean
valjean
was
dead
and
published
the
fact
in
such
formal
terms
that
javert
did
not
doubt
it
he
confined
himself
to
the
remark
that
s
a
good
entry
then
he
threw
aside
the
paper
and
thought
no
more
about
it
some
time
afterwards
it
chanced
that
a
police
report
was
transmitted
from
the
prefecture
of
the
seine
et
oise
to
the
prefecture
of
police
in
paris
concerning
the
abduction
of
a
child
which
had
taken
place
under
peculiar
circumstances
as
it
was
said
in
the
commune
of
montfermeil
a
little
girl
of
seven
or
eight
years
of
age
the
report
said
who
had
been
intrusted
by
her
mother
to
an
inn
keeper
of
that
neighborhood
had
been
stolen
by
a
stranger
this
child
answered
to
the
name
of
cosette
and
was
the
daughter
of
a
girl
named
fantine
who
had
died
in
the
hospital
it
was
not
known
where
or
when
this
report
came
under
javert
s
eye
and
set
him
to
thinking
the
name
of
fantine
was
well
known
to
him
he
remembered
that
jean
valjean
had
made
him
javert
burst
into
laughter
by
asking
him
for
a
respite
of
three
days
for
the
purpose
of
going
to
fetch
that
creature
s
child
he
recalled
the
fact
that
jean
valjean
had
been
arrested
in
paris
at
the
very
moment
when
he
was
stepping
into
the
coach
for
montfermeil
some
signs
had
made
him
suspect
at
the
time
that
this
was
the
second
occasion
of
his
entering
that
coach
and
that
he
had
already
on
the
previous
day
made
an
excursion
to
the
neighborhood
of
that
village
for
he
had
not
been
seen
in
the
village
itself
what
had
he
been
intending
to
do
in
that
region
of
montfermeil
it
could
not
even
be
surmised
javert
understood
it
now
fantine
s
daughter
was
there
jean
valjean
was
going
there
in
search
of
her
and
now
this
child
had
been
stolen
by
a
stranger
who
could
that
stranger
be
could
it
be
jean
valjean
but
jean
valjean
was
dead
javert
without
saying
anything
to
anybody
took
the
coach
from
the
pewter
platter
cul
de
sac
de
la
planchette
and
made
a
trip
to
montfermeil
he
expected
to
find
a
great
deal
of
light
on
the
subject
there
he
found
a
great
deal
of
obscurity
for
the
first
few
days
the
thenardiers
had
chattered
in
their
rage
the
disappearance
of
the
lark
had
created
a
sensation
in
the
village
he
immediately
obtained
numerous
versions
of
the
story
which
ended
in
the
abduction
of
a
child
hence
the
police
report
but
their
first
vexation
having
passed
off
thenardier
with
his
wonderful
instinct
had
very
quickly
comprehended
that
it
is
never
advisable
to
stir
up
the
prosecutor
of
the
crown
and
that
his
complaints
with
regard
to
the
abduction
of
cosette
would
have
as
their
first
result
to
fix
upon
himself
and
upon
many
dark
affairs
which
he
had
on
hand
the
glittering
eye
of
justice
the
last
thing
that
owls
desire
is
to
have
a
candle
brought
to
them
and
in
the
first
place
how
explain
the
fifteen
hundred
francs
which
he
had
received
he
turned
squarely
round
put
a
gag
on
his
wife
s
mouth
and
feigned
astonishment
when
the
stolen
child
was
mentioned
to
him
he
understood
nothing
about
it
no
doubt
he
had
grumbled
for
awhile
at
having
that
dear
little
creature
taken
from
him
so
hastily
he
should
have
liked
to
keep
her
two
or
three
days
longer
out
of
tenderness
but
her
grandfather
had
come
for
her
in
the
most
natural
way
in
the
world
he
added
the
grandfather
which
produced
a
good
effect
this
was
the
story
that
javert
hit
upon
when
he
arrived
at
montfermeil
the
grandfather
caused
jean
valjean
to
vanish
nevertheless
javert
dropped
a
few
questions
like
plummets
into
thenardier
s
history
who
was
that
grandfather
and
what
was
his
name
thenardier
replied
with
simplicity
he
is
a
wealthy
farmer
i
saw
his
passport
i
think
his
name
was
m
guillaume
lambert
lambert
is
a
respectable
and
extremely
reassuring
name
thereupon
javert
returned
to
paris
jean
valjean
is
certainly
dead
said
he
and
i
am
a
ninny
he
had
again
begun
to
forget
this
history
when
in
the
course
of
march
1824
he
heard
of
a
singular
personage
who
dwelt
in
the
parish
of
saint
medard
and
who
had
been
surnamed
the
mendicant
who
gives
alms
this
person
the
story
ran
was
a
man
of
means
whose
name
no
one
knew
exactly
and
who
lived
alone
with
a
little
girl
of
eight
years
who
knew
nothing
about
herself
save
that
she
had
come
from
montfermeil
montfermeil
that
name
was
always
coming
up
and
it
made
javert
prick
up
his
ears
an
old
beggar
police
spy
an
ex
beadle
to
whom
this
person
had
given
alms
added
a
few
more
details
this
gentleman
of
property
was
very
shy
never
coming
out
except
in
the
evening
speaking
to
no
one
except
occasionally
to
the
poor
and
never
allowing
any
one
to
approach
him
he
wore
a
horrible
old
yellow
frock
coat
which
was
worth
many
millions
being
all
wadded
with
bank
bills
this
piqued
javert
s
curiosity
in
a
decided
manner
in
order
to
get
a
close
look
at
this
fantastic
gentleman
without
alarming
him
he
borrowed
the
beadle
s
outfit
for
a
day
and
the
place
where
the
old
spy
was
in
the
habit
of
crouching
every
evening
whining
orisons
through
his
nose
and
playing
the
spy
under
cover
of
prayer
the
suspected
individual
did
indeed
approach
javert
thus
disguised
and
bestow
alms
on
him
at
that
moment
javert
raised
his
head
and
the
shock
which
jean
valjean
received
on
recognizing
javert
was
equal
to
the
one
received
by
javert
when
he
thought
he
recognized
jean
valjean
however
the
darkness
might
have
misled
him
jean
valjean
s
death
was
official
javert
cherished
very
grave
doubts
and
when
in
doubt
javert
the
man
of
scruples
never
laid
a
finger
on
any
one
s
collar
he
followed
his
man
to
the
gorbeau
house
and
got
the
old
woman
to
talking
which
was
no
difficult
matter
the
old
woman
confirmed
the
fact
regarding
the
coat
lined
with
millions
and
narrated
to
him
the
episode
of
the
thousand
franc
bill
she
had
seen
it
she
had
handled
it
javert
hired
a
room
that
evening
he
installed
himself
in
it
he
came
and
listened
at
the
mysterious
lodger
s
door
hoping
to
catch
the
sound
of
his
voice
but
jean
valjean
saw
his
candle
through
the
key
hole
and
foiled
the
spy
by
keeping
silent
on
the
following
day
jean
valjean
decamped
but
the
noise
made
by
the
fall
of
the
five
franc
piece
was
noticed
by
the
old
woman
who
hearing
the
rattling
of
coin
suspected
that
he
might
be
intending
to
leave
and
made
haste
to
warn
javert
at
night
when
jean
valjean
came
out
javert
was
waiting
for
him
behind
the
trees
of
the
boulevard
with
two
men
javert
had
demanded
assistance
at
the
prefecture
but
he
had
not
mentioned
the
name
of
the
individual
whom
he
hoped
to
seize
that
was
his
secret
and
he
had
kept
it
for
three
reasons
in
the
first
place
because
the
slightest
indiscretion
might
put
jean
valjean
on
the
alert
next
because
to
lay
hands
on
an
ex
convict
who
had
made
his
escape
and
was
reputed
dead
on
a
criminal
whom
justice
had
formerly
classed
forever
as
among
malefactors
of
the
most
dangerous
sort
was
a
magnificent
success
which
the
old
members
of
the
parisian
police
would
assuredly
not
leave
to
a
new
comer
like
javert
and
he
was
afraid
of
being
deprived
of
his
convict
and
lastly
because
javert
being
an
artist
had
a
taste
for
the
unforeseen
he
hated
those
well
heralded
successes
which
are
talked
of
long
in
advance
and
have
had
the
bloom
brushed
off
he
preferred
to
elaborate
his
masterpieces
in
the
dark
and
to
unveil
them
suddenly
at
the
last
javert
had
followed
jean
valjean
from
tree
to
tree
then
from
corner
to
corner
of
the
street
and
had
not
lost
sight
of
him
for
a
single
instant
even
at
the
moments
when
jean
valjean
believed
himself
to
be
the
most
secure
javert
s
eye
had
been
on
him
why
had
not
javert
arrested
jean
valjean
because
he
was
still
in
doubt
it
must
be
remembered
that
at
that
epoch
the
police
was
not
precisely
at
its
ease
the
free
press
embarrassed
it
several
arbitrary
arrests
denounced
by
the
newspapers
had
echoed
even
as
far
as
the
chambers
and
had
rendered
the
prefecture
timid
interference
with
individual
liberty
was
a
grave
matter
the
police
agents
were
afraid
of
making
a
mistake
the
prefect
laid
the
blame
on
them
a
mistake
meant
dismissal
the
reader
can
imagine
the
effect
which
this
brief
paragraph
reproduced
by
twenty
newspapers
would
have
caused
in
paris
yesterday
an
aged
grandfather
with
white
hair
a
respectable
and
well
to
do
gentleman
who
was
walking
with
his
grandchild
aged
eight
was
arrested
and
conducted
to
the
agency
of
the
prefecture
as
an
escaped
convict
let
us
repeat
in
addition
that
javert
had
scruples
of
his
own
injunctions
of
his
conscience
were
added
to
the
injunctions
of
the
prefect
he
was
really
in
doubt
jean
valjean
turned
his
back
on
him
and
walked
in
the
dark
sadness
uneasiness
anxiety
depression
this
fresh
misfortune
of
being
forced
to
flee
by
night
to
seek
a
chance
refuge
in
paris
for
cosette
and
himself
the
necessity
of
regulating
his
pace
to
the
pace
of
the
child
all
this
without
his
being
aware
of
it
had
altered
jean
valjean
s
walk
and
impressed
on
his
bearing
such
senility
that
the
police
themselves
incarnate
in
the
person
of
javert
might
and
did
in
fact
make
a
mistake
the
impossibility
of
approaching
too
close
his
costume
of
an
emigre
preceptor
the
declaration
of
thenardier
which
made
a
grandfather
of
him
and
finally
the
belief
in
his
death
in
prison
added
still
further
to
the
uncertainty
which
gathered
thick
in
javert
s
mind
for
an
instant
it
occurred
to
him
to
make
an
abrupt
demand
for
his
papers
but
if
the
man
was
not
jean
valjean
and
if
this
man
was
not
a
good
honest
old
fellow
living
on
his
income
he
was
probably
some
merry
blade
deeply
and
cunningly
implicated
in
the
obscure
web
of
parisian
misdeeds
some
chief
of
a
dangerous
band
who
gave
alms
to
conceal
his
other
talents
which
was
an
old
dodge
he
had
trusty
fellows
accomplices
retreats
in
case
of
emergencies
in
which
he
would
no
doubt
take
refuge
all
these
turns
which
he
was
making
through
the
streets
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
was
not
a
simple
and
honest
man
to
arrest
him
too
hastily
would
be
to
kill
the
hen
that
laid
the
golden
eggs
where
was
the
inconvenience
in
waiting
javert
was
very
sure
that
he
would
not
escape
thus
he
proceeded
in
a
tolerably
perplexed
state
of
mind
putting
to
himself
a
hundred
questions
about
this
enigmatical
personage
it
was
only
quite
late
in
the
rue
de
pontoise
that
thanks
to
the
brilliant
light
thrown
from
a
dram
shop
he
decidedly
recognized
jean
valjean
there
are
in
this
world
two
beings
who
give
a
profound
start
the
mother
who
recovers
her
child
and
the
tiger
who
recovers
his
prey
javert
gave
that
profound
start
as
soon
as
he
had
positively
recognized
jean
valjean
the
formidable
convict
he
perceived
that
there
were
only
three
of
them
and
he
asked
for
reinforcements
at
the
police
station
of
the
rue
de
pontoise
one
puts
on
gloves
before
grasping
a
thorn
cudgel
this
delay
and
the
halt
at
the
carrefour
rollin
to
consult
with
his
agents
came
near
causing
him
to
lose
the
trail
he
speedily
divined
however
that
jean
valjean
would
want
to
put
the
river
between
his
pursuers
and
himself
he
bent
his
head
and
reflected
like
a
blood
hound
who
puts
his
nose
to
the
ground
to
make
sure
that
he
is
on
the
right
scent
javert
with
his
powerful
rectitude
of
instinct
went
straight
to
the
bridge
of
austerlitz
a
word
with
the
toll
keeper
furnished
him
with
the
information
which
he
required
have
you
seen
a
man
with
a
little
girl
i
made
him
pay
two
sous
replied
the
toll
keeper
javert
reached
the
bridge
in
season
to
see
jean
valjean
traverse
the
small
illuminated
spot
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
leading
cosette
by
the
hand
he
saw
him
enter
the
rue
du
chemin
vert
saint
antoine
he
remembered
the
cul
de
sac
genrot
arranged
there
like
a
trap
and
of
the
sole
exit
of
the
rue
droit
mur
into
the
rue
petit
picpus
he
made
sure
of
his
back
burrows
as
huntsmen
say
he
hastily
despatched
one
of
his
agents
by
a
roundabout
way
to
guard
that
issue
a
patrol
which
was
returning
to
the
arsenal
post
having
passed
him
he
made
a
requisition
on
it
and
caused
it
to
accompany
him
in
such
games
soldiers
are
aces
moreover
the
principle
is
that
in
order
to
get
the
best
of
a
wild
boar
one
must
employ
the
science
of
venery
and
plenty
of
dogs
these
combinations
having
been
effected
feeling
that
jean
valjean
was
caught
between
the
blind
alley
genrot
on
the
right
his
agent
on
the
left
and
himself
javert
in
the
rear
he
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
then
he
began
the
game
he
experienced
one
ecstatic
and
infernal
moment
he
allowed
his
man
to
go
on
ahead
knowing
that
he
had
him
safe
but
desirous
of
postponing
the
moment
of
arrest
as
long
as
possible
happy
at
the
thought
that
he
was
taken
and
yet
at
seeing
him
free
gloating
over
him
with
his
gaze
with
that
voluptuousness
of
the
spider
which
allows
the
fly
to
flutter
and
of
the
cat
which
lets
the
mouse
run
claws
and
talons
possess
a
monstrous
sensuality
the
obscure
movements
of
the
creature
imprisoned
in
their
pincers
what
a
delight
this
strangling
is
javert
was
enjoying
himself
the
meshes
of
his
net
were
stoutly
knotted
he
was
sure
of
success
all
he
had
to
do
now
was
to
close
his
hand
accompanied
as
he
was
the
very
idea
of
resistance
was
impossible
however
vigorous
energetic
and
desperate
jean
valjean
might
be
javert
on
the
hunt
javert
advanced
slowly
sounding
searching
on
his
way
all
the
nooks
of
the
street
like
so
many
pockets
of
thieves
when
he
reached
the
centre
of
the
web
he
found
the
fly
no
longer
there
his
exasperation
can
be
imagined
he
interrogated
his
sentinel
of
the
rues
droit
mur
and
petit
picpus
that
agent
who
had
remained
imperturbably
at
his
post
had
not
seen
the
man
pass
it
sometimes
happens
that
a
stag
is
lost
head
and
horns
that
is
to
say
he
escapes
although
he
has
the
pack
on
his
very
heels

not

it
was
not
a

a

javert
would
have
liked
to
utter
the
same
cry
his
disappointment
bordered
for
a
moment
on
despair
and
rage
it
is
certain
that
napoleon
made
mistakes
during
the
war
with
russia
that
alexander
committed
blunders
in
the
war
in

that
caesar
made
mistakes
in
the

in

that
cyrus
was
at
fault
in
the
war
in
scythia
and
that
javert
blundered
in
this
campaign
against
jean
valjean
he
was
wrong
perhaps
in
hesitating
in
his
recognition
of
the
exconvict
the
first
glance
should
have
sufficed
him
he
was
wrong
in
not
arresting
him
purely
and
simply
in
the
old
building
he
was
wrong
in
not
arresting
him
when
he
positively
recognized
him
in
the
rue
de
pontoise
he
was
wrong
in
taking
counsel
with
his
auxiliaries
in
the
full
light
of
the
moon
in
the
carrefour
rollin
advice
is
certainly
useful
it
is
a
good
thing
to
know
and
to
interrogate
those
of
the
dogs
who
deserve
confidence
but
the
hunter
cannot
be
too
cautious
when
he
is
chasing
uneasy
animals
like
the
wolf
and
the
convict
javert
by
taking
too
much
thought
as
to
how
he
should
set
the
bloodhounds
of
the
pack
on
the
trail
alarmed
the
beast
by
giving
him
wind
of
the
dart
and
so
made
him
run
above
all
he
was
wrong
in
that
after
he
had
picked
up
the
scent
again
on
the
bridge
of
austerlitz
he
played
that
formidable
and
puerile
game
of
keeping
such
a
man
at
the
end
of
a
thread
he
thought
himself
stronger
than
he
was
and
believed
that
he
could
play
at
the
game
of
the
mouse
and
the
lion
at
the
same
time
he
reckoned
himself
as
too
weak
when
he
judged
it
necessary
to
obtain
reinforcement
fatal
precaution
waste
of
precious
time
javert
committed
all
these
blunders
and
none
the
less
was
one
of
the
cleverest
and
most
correct
spies
that
ever
existed
he
was
in
the
full
force
of
the
term
what
is
called
in

a
knowing
dog
but
what
is
there
that
is
perfect
great
strategists
have
their

the
greatest
follies
are
often
composed
like
the
largest
ropes
of
a
multitude
of
strands
take
the
cable
thread
by

take
all
the
petty
determining

and
you
can
break
them
one
after
the
other
and
you
say
that

that
may

at

javert
did
not
lose
his
head
sure
that
the
convict
who
had
broken
his
ban
could
not
be
far
off
he
established
sentinels
he
organized

and
ambuscades
and
beat
the
quarter
all
that
night
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
the
disorder
in
the

lantern
whose
rope
had
been
cut
a
precious
sign
which
however
led
him
astray
since
it
caused
him
to
turn
all
his
researches
in
the
direction
of
the
cul

in
this
blind
alley
there
were
tolerably
low
walls
which
abutted
on
gardens
whose
bounds
adjoined
the
immense
stretches
of
waste
land
jean
valjean
evidently
must
have
fled
in
that
direction
the
fact
is
that
had
he
penetrated
a
little
further
in
the
cul
de

genrot
he
would
probably
have
done
so
and
have
been
lost
javert
explored
these
gardens
and
these
waste
stretches
as
though
he
had
been
hunting
for
a
needle
at
daybreak
he
left
two
intelligent
men
on
the
outlook
and
returned
to
the

half

more
resembled
every

than
the
carriage
gate
of

rue

this
entrance
which
usually
stood
ajar
in
the
most
inviting
fashion
permitted
a
view
of
two
things
neither
of
which
have
anything
very
funereal
about
them
a
courtyard
surrounded
by
walls
hung
with
vines
and
the
face
of
a
lounging
porter
above
the
wall
at
the
bottom
of
the
court
tall
trees
were
visible
when
a
ray
of
sunlight
enlivened
the
courtyard
when
a
glass
of
wine
cheered
up
the
porter
it
was
difficult
to
pass
number

little
picpus
street
without
carrying
away
a
smiling
impression
of
it
nevertheless
it
was
a
sombre
place
of
which
one
had
had
a
glimpse
the
threshold
smiled
the
house
prayed
and
wept
if
one
succeeded
in
passing
the
porter
which
was
not
easy
which
was
even
nearly
impossible
for
every
one
for
there
was
an
open
sesame
which
it
was
necessary
to
know
if
the
porter
once
passed
one
entered
a
little
vestibule
on
the
right
on
which
opened
a
staircase
shut
in
between
two
walls
and
so
narrow
that
only
one
person
could
ascend
it
at
a
time
if
one
did
not
allow
one
s
self
to
be
alarmed
by
a
daubing
of
canary
yellow
with
a
dado
of
chocolate
which
clothed
this
staircase
if
one
ventured
to
ascend
it
one
crossed
a
first
landing
then
a
second
and
arrived
on
the
first
story
at
a
corridor
where
the
yellow
wash
and
the
chocolate
hued
plinth
pursued
one
with
a
peaceable
persistency
staircase
and
corridor
were
lighted
by
two
beautiful
windows
the
corridor
took
a
turn
and
became
dark
if
one
doubled
this
cape
one
arrived
a
few
paces
further
on
in
front
of
a
door
which
was
all
the
more
mysterious
because
it
was
not
fastened
if
one
opened
it
one
found
one
s
self
in
a
little
chamber
about
six
feet
square
tiled
well
scrubbed
clean
cold
and
hung
with
nankin
paper
with
green
flowers
at
fifteen
sous
the
roll
a
white
dull
light
fell
from
a
large
window
with
tiny
panes
on
the
left
which
usurped
the
whole
width
of
the
room
one
gazed
about
but
saw
no
one
one
listened
one
heard
neither
a
footstep
nor
a
human
murmur
the
walls
were
bare
the
chamber
was
not
furnished
there
was
not
even
a
chair
one
looked
again
and
beheld
on
the
wall
facing
the
door
a
quadrangular
hole
about
a
foot
square
with
a
grating
of
interlacing
iron
bars
black
knotted
solid
which
formed
squares
i
had
almost
said
meshes
of
less
than
an
inch
and
a
half
in
diagonal
length
the
little
green
flowers
of
the
nankin
paper
ran
in
a
calm
and
orderly
manner
to
those
iron
bars
without
being
startled
or
thrown
into
confusion
by
their
funereal
contact
supposing
that
a
living
being
had
been
so
wonderfully
thin
as
to
essay
an
entrance
or
an
exit
through
the
square
hole
this
grating
would
have
prevented
it
it
did
not
allow
the
passage
of
the
body
but
it
did
allow
the
passage
of
the
eyes
that
is
to
say
of
the
mind
this
seems
to
have
occurred
to
them
for
it
had
been
re
enforced
by
a
sheet
of
tin
inserted
in
the
wall
a
little
in
the
rear
and
pierced
with
a
thousand
holes
more
microscopic
than
the
holes
of
a
strainer
at
the
bottom
of
this
plate
an
aperture
had
been
pierced
exactly
similar
to
the
orifice
of
a
letter
box
a
bit
of
tape
attached
to
a
bell
wire
hung
at
the
right
of
the
grated
opening
if
the
tape
was
pulled
a
bell
rang
and
one
heard
a
voice
very
near
at
hand
which
made
one
start
who
is
there
the
voice
demanded
it
was
a
woman
s
voice
a
gentle
voice
so
gentle
that
it
was
mournful
here
again
there
was
a
magical
word
which
it
was
necessary
to
know
if
one
did
not
know
it
the
voice
ceased
the
wall
became
silent
once
more
as
though
the
terrified
obscurity
of
the
sepulchre
had
been
on
the
other
side
of
it
if
one
knew
the
password
the
voice
resumed
enter
on
the
right
one
then
perceived
on
the
right
facing
the
window
a
glass
door
surmounted
by
a
frame
glazed
and
painted
gray
on
raising
the
latch
and
crossing
the
threshold
one
experienced
precisely
the
same
impression
as
when
one
enters
at
the
theatre
into
a
grated
baignoire
before
the
grating
is
lowered
and
the
chandelier
is
lighted
one
was
in
fact
in
a
sort
of
theatre
box
narrow
furnished
with
two
old
chairs
and
a
much
frayed
straw
matting
sparely
illuminated
by
the
vague
light
from
the
glass
door
a
regular
box
with
its
front
just
of
a
height
to
lean
upon
bearing
a
tablet
of
black
wood
this
box
was
grated
only
the
grating
of
it
was
not
of
gilded
wood
as
at
the
opera
it
was
a
monstrous
lattice
of
iron
bars
hideously
interlaced
and
riveted
to
the
wall
by
enormous
fastenings
which
resembled
clenched
fists
the
first
minutes
passed
when
one
s
eyes
began
to
grow
used
to
this
cellar
like
half
twilight
one
tried
to
pass
the
grating
but
got
no
further
than
six
inches
beyond
it
there
he
encountered
a
barrier
of
black
shutters
re
enforced
and
fortified
with
transverse
beams
of
wood
painted
a
gingerbread
yellow
these
shutters
were
divided
into
long
narrow
slats
and
they
masked
the
entire
length
of
the
grating
they
were
always
closed
at
the
expiration
of
a
few
moments
one
heard
a
voice
proceeding
from
behind
these
shutters
and
saying
i
am
here
what
do
you
wish
with
me
it
was
a
beloved
sometimes
an
adored
voice
no
one
was
visible
hardly
the
sound
of
a
breath
was
audible
it
seemed
as
though
it
were
a
spirit
which
had
been
evoked
that
was
speaking
to
you
across
the
walls
of
the
tomb
if
one
chanced
to
be
within
certain
prescribed
and
very
rare
conditions
the
slat
of
one
of
the
shutters
opened
opposite
you
the
evoked
spirit
became
an
apparition
behind
the
grating
behind
the
shutter
one
perceived
so
far
as
the
grating
permitted
sight
a
head
of
which
only
the
mouth
and
the
chin
were
visible
the
rest
was
covered
with
a
black
veil
one
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
black
guimpe
and
a
form
that
was
barely
defined
covered
with
a
black
shroud
that
head
spoke
with
you
but
did
not
look
at
you
and
never
smiled
at
you
the
light
which
came
from
behind
you
was
adjusted
in
such
a
manner
that
you
saw
her
in
the
white
and
she
saw
you
in
the
black
this
light
was
symbolical
nevertheless
your
eyes
plunged
eagerly
through
that
opening
which
was
made
in
that
place
shut
off
from
all
glances
a
profound
vagueness
enveloped
that
form
clad
in
mourning
your
eyes
searched
that
vagueness
and
sought
to
make
out
the
surroundings
of
the
apparition
at
the
expiration
of
a
very
short
time
you
discovered
that
you
could
see
nothing
what
you
beheld
was
night
emptiness
shadows
a
wintry
mist
mingled
with
a
vapor
from
the
tomb
a
sort
of
terrible
peace
a
silence
from
which
you
could
gather
nothing
not
even
sighs
a
gloom
in
which
you
could
distinguish
nothing
not
even
phantoms
what
you
beheld
was
the
interior
of
a
cloister
it
was
the
interior
of
that
severe
and
gloomy
edifice
which
was
called
the
convent
of
the
bernardines
of
the
perpetual
adoration
the
box
in
which
you
stood
was
the
parlor
the
first
voice
which
had
addressed
you
was
that
of
the
portress
who
always
sat
motionless
and
silent
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
near
the
square
opening
screened
by
the
iron
grating
and
the
plate
with
its
thousand
holes
as
by
a
double
visor
the
obscurity
which
bathed
the
grated
box
arose
from
the
fact
that
the
parlor
which
had
a
window
on
the
side
of
the
world
had
none
on
the
side
of
the
convent
profane
eyes
must
see
nothing
of
that
sacred
place
nevertheless
there
was
something
beyond
that
shadow
there
was
a
light
there
was
life
in
the
midst
of
that
death
although
this
was
the
most
strictly
walled
of
all
convents
we
shall
endeavor
to
make
our
way
into
it
and
to
take
the
reader
in
and
to
say
without
transgressing
the
proper
bounds
things
which
story
tellers
have
never
seen
and
have
therefore
never
described
chapter
ii
the
obedience
of
martin
verga
this
convent
which
in
1824
had
already
existed
for
many
a
long
year
in
the
rue
petit
picpus
was
a
community
of
bernardines
of
the
obedience
of
martin
verga
these
bernardines
were
attached
in
consequence
not
to
clairvaux
like
the
bernardine
monks
but
to
citeaux
like
the
benedictine
monks
in
other
words
they
were
the
subjects
not
of
saint
bernard
but
of
saint
benoit
any
one
who
has
turned
over
old
folios
to
any
extent
knows
that
martin
verga
founded
in
1425
a
congregation
of
bernardines
benedictines
with
salamanca
for
the
head
of
the
order
and
alcala
as
the
branch
establishment
this
congregation
had
sent
out
branches
throughout
all
the
catholic
countries
of
europe
there
is
nothing
unusual
in
the
latin
church
in
these
grafts
of
one
order
on
another
to
mention
only
a
single
order
of
saint
benoit
which
is
here
in
question
there
are
attached
to
this
order
without
counting
the
obedience
of
martin
verga
four
congregations
two
in

and

in

and
lastly

for
citeaux
itself
a
trunk
for
other
orders
is
only
an
offshoot
of
saint
benoit
citeaux
dates
from
saint
robert
abbe
de
molesme
in
the
diocese
of
langres
in
1098
now
it
was
in
529
that
the
devil
having
retired
to
the
desert
of
subiaco
he
was
old
had
he
turned
hermit
was
chased
from
the
ancient
temple
of
apollo
where
he
dwelt
by
saint
benoit
then
aged
seventeen
after
the
rule
of
the
carmelites
who
go
barefoot
wear
a
bit
of
willow
on
their
throats
and
never
sit
down
the
harshest
rule
is
that
of
the
bernardines
benedictines
of
martin
verga
they
are
clothed
in
black
with
a
guimpe
which
in
accordance
with
the
express
command
of
saint
benoit
mounts
to
the
chin
a
robe
of
serge
with
large
sleeves
a
large
woollen
veil
the
guimpe
which
mounts
to
the
chin
cut
square
on
the
breast
the
band
which
descends
over
their
brow
to
their
eyes
this
is
their
dress
all
is
black
except
the
band
which
is
white
the
novices
wear
the
same
habit
but
all
in
white
the
professed
nuns
also
wear
a
rosary
at
their
side
the
bernardines
benedictines
of
martin
verga
practise
the
perpetual
adoration
like
the
benedictines
called
ladies
of
the
holy
sacrament
who
at
the
beginning
of
this
century
had
two
houses
in
paris
one
at
the
temple
the
other
in
the
rue
neuve
sainte
genevieve
however
the
bernardines
benedictines
of
the
petit
picpus
of
whom
we
are
speaking
were
a
totally
different
order
from
the
ladies
of
the
holy
sacrament
cloistered
in
the
rue
neuve
sainte
genevieve
and
at
the
temple
there
were
numerous
differences
in
their
rule
there
were
some
in
their
costume
the
bernardines
benedictines
of
the
petit
picpus
wore
the
black
guimpe
and
the
benedictines
of
the
holy
sacrament
and
of
the
rue
neuve
sainte
genevieve
wore
a
white
one
and
had
besides
on
their
breasts
a
holy
sacrament
about
three
inches
long
in
silver
gilt
or
gilded
copper
the
nuns
of
the
petit
picpus
did
not
wear
this
holy
sacrament
the
perpetual
adoration
which
was
common
to
the
house
of
the
petit
picpus
and
to
the
house
of
the
temple
leaves
those
two
orders
perfectly
distinct
their
only
resemblance
lies
in
this
practice
of
the
ladies
of
the
holy
sacrament
and
the
bernardines
of
martin
verga
just
as
there
existed
a
similarity
in
the
study
and
the
glorification
of
all
the
mysteries
relating
to
the
infancy
the
life
and
death
of
jesus
christ
and
the
virgin
between
the
two
orders
which
were
nevertheless
widely
separated
and
on
occasion
even
hostile
the
oratory
of
italy
established
at
florence
by
philip
de
neri
and
the
oratory
of
france
established
by
pierre
de
berulle
the
oratory
of
france
claimed
the
precedence
since
philip
de
neri
was
only
a
saint
while
berulle
was
a
cardinal
let
us
return
to
the
harsh
spanish
rule
of
martin
verga
the
bernardines
benedictines
of
this
obedience
fast
all
the
year
round
abstain
from
meat
fast
in
lent
and
on
many
other
days
which
are
peculiar
to
them
rise
from
their
first
sleep
from
one
to
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
to
read
their
breviary
and
chant
matins
sleep
in
all
seasons
between
serge
sheets
and
on
straw
make
no
use
of
the
bath
never
light
a
fire
scourge
themselves
every
friday
observe
the
rule
of
silence
speak
to
each
other
only
during
the
recreation
hours
which
are
very
brief
and
wear
drugget
chemises
for
six
months
in
the
year
from
september
14th
which
is
the
exaltation
of
the
holy
cross
until
easter
these
six
months
are
a
modification
the
rule
says
all
the
year
but
this
drugget
chemise
intolerable
in
the
heat
of
summer
produced
fevers
and
nervous
spasms
the
use
of
it
had
to
be
restricted
even
with
this
palliation
when
the
nuns
put
on
this
chemise
on
the
14th
of
september
they
suffer
from
fever
for
three
or
four
days
obedience
poverty
chastity
perseverance
in
their
seclusion
these
are
their
vows
which
the
rule
greatly
aggravates
the
prioress
is
elected
for
three
years
by
the
mothers
who
are
called
meres
vocales
because
they
have
a
voice
in
the
chapter
a
prioress
can
only
be
re
elected
twice
which
fixes
the
longest
possible
reign
of
a
prioress
at
nine
years
they
never
see
the
officiating
priest
who
is
always
hidden
from
them
by
a
serge
curtain
nine
feet
in
height
during
the
sermon
when
the
preacher
is
in
the
chapel
they
drop
their
veils
over
their
faces
they
must
always
speak
low
walk
with
their
eyes
on
the
ground
and
their
heads
bowed
one
man
only
is
allowed
to
enter
the
convent
the
archbishop
of
the
diocese
there
is
really
one
other
the
gardener
but
he
is
always
an
old
man
and
in
order
that
he
may
always
be
alone
in
the
garden
and
that
the
nuns
may
be
warned
to
avoid
him
a
bell
is
attached
to
his
knee
their
submission
to
the
prioress
is
absolute
and
passive
it
is
the
canonical
subjection
in
the
full
force
of
its
abnegation
as
at
the
voice
of
christ
ut
voci
christi
at
a
gesture
at
the
first
sign
ad
nutum
ad
primum
signum
immediately
with
cheerfulness
with
perseverance
with
a
certain
blind
obedience
prompte
hilariter
perseveranter
et
caeca
quadam
obedientia
as
the
file
in
the
hand
of
the
workman
quasi
limam
in
manibus
fabri
without
power
to
read
or
to
write
without
express
permission
legere
vel
scribere
non
addiscerit
sine
expressa
superioris
licentia
each
one
of
them
in
turn
makes
what
they
call
reparation
the
reparation
is
the
prayer
for
all
the
sins
for
all
the
faults
for
all
the
dissensions
for
all
the
violations
for
all
the
iniquities
for
all
the
crimes
committed
on
earth
for
the
space
of
twelve
consecutive
hours
from
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
till
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
or
from
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
until
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
the
sister
who
is
making
reparation
remains
on
her
knees
on
the
stone
before
the
holy
sacrament
with
hands
clasped
a
rope
around
her
neck
when
her
fatigue
becomes
unendurable
she
prostrates
herself
flat
on
her
face
against
the
earth
with
her
arms
outstretched
in
the
form
of
a
cross
this
is
her
only
relief
in
this
attitude
she
prays
for
all
the
guilty
in
the
universe
this
is
great
to
sublimity
as
this
act
is
performed
in
front
of
a
post
on
which
burns
a
candle
it
is
called
without
distinction
to
make
reparation
or
to
be
at
the
post
the
nuns
even
prefer
out
of
humility
this
last
expression
which
contains
an
idea
of
torture
and
abasement
to
make
reparation
is
a
function
in
which
the
whole
soul
is
absorbed
the
sister
at
the
post
would
not
turn
round
were
a
thunderbolt
to
fall
directly
behind
her
besides
this
there
is
always
a
sister
kneeling
before
the
holy
sacrament
this
station
lasts
an
hour
they
relieve
each
other
like
soldiers
on
guard
this
is
the
perpetual
adoration
the
prioresses
and
the
mothers
almost
always
bear
names
stamped
with
peculiar
solemnity
recalling
not
the
saints
and
martyrs
but
moments
in
the
life
of
jesus
christ
as
mother
nativity
mother
conception
mother
presentation
mother
passion
but
the
names
of
saints
are
not
interdicted
when
one
sees
them
one
never
sees
anything
but
their
mouths
all
their
teeth
are
yellow
no
tooth
brush
ever
entered
that
convent
brushing
one
s
teeth
is
at
the
top
of
a
ladder
at
whose
bottom
is
the
loss
of
one
s
soul
they
never
say
my
they
possess
nothing
of
their
own
and
they
must
not
attach
themselves
to
anything
they
call
everything
our
thus
our
veil
our
chaplet
if
they
were
speaking
of
their
chemise
they
would
say
our
chemise
sometimes
they
grow
attached
to
some
petty
object
to
a
book
of
hours
a
relic
a
medal
that
has
been
blessed
as
soon
as
they
become
aware
that
they
are
growing
attached
to
this
object
they
must
give
it
up
they
recall
the
words
of
saint
therese
to
whom
a
great
lady
said
as
she
was
on
the
point
of
entering
her
order
permit
me
mother
to
send
for
a
bible
to
which
i
am
greatly
attached
ah
you
are
attached
to
something
in
that
case
do
not
enter
our
order
every
person
whatever
is
forbidden
to
shut
herself
up
to
have
a
place
of
her
own
a
chamber
they
live
with
their
cells
open
when
they
meet
one
says
blessed
and
adored
be
the
most
holy
sacrament
of
the
altar
the
other
responds
forever
the
same
ceremony
when
one
taps
at
the
other
s
door
hardly
has
she
touched
the
door
when
a
soft
voice
on
the
other
side
is
heard
to
say
hastily
forever
like
all
practices
this
becomes
mechanical
by
force
of
habit
and
one
sometimes
says
forever
before
the
other
has
had
time
to
say
the
rather
long
sentence
praised
and
adored
be
the
most
holy
sacrament
of
the
altar
among
the
visitandines
the
one
who
enters
says
ave
maria
and
the
one
whose
cell
is
entered
says
gratia
plena
it
is
their
way
of
saying
good
day
which
is
in
fact
full
of
grace
at
each
hour
of
the
day
three
supplementary
strokes
sound
from
the
church
bell
of
the
convent
at
this
signal
prioress
vocal
mothers
professed
nuns
lay
sisters
novices
postulants
interrupt
what
they
are
saying
what
they
are
doing
or
what
they
are
thinking
and
all
say
in
unison
if
it
is
five
o
clock
for
instance
at
five
o
clock
and
at
all
hours
praised
and
adored
be
the
most
holy
sacrament
of
the
altar
if
it
is
eight
o
clock
at
eight
o
clock
and
at
all
hours
and
so
on
according
to
the
hour
this
custom
the
object
of
which
is
to
break
the
thread
of
thought
and
to
lead
it
back
constantly
to
god
exists
in
many
communities
the
formula
alone
varies
thus
at
the
infant
jesus
they
say
at
this
hour
and
at
every
hour
may
the
love
of
jesus
kindle
my
heart
the
bernardines
benedictines
of
martin
verga
cloistered
fifty
years
ago
at
petit
picpus
chant
the
offices
to
a
solemn
psalmody
a
pure
gregorian
chant
and
always
with
full
voice
during
the
whole
course
of
the
office
everywhere
in
the
missal
where
an
asterisk
occurs
they
pause
and
say
in
a
low
voice
jesus
marie
joseph
for
the
office
of
the
dead
they
adopt
a
tone
so
low
that
the
voices
of
women
can
hardly
descend
to
such
a
depth
the
effect
produced
is
striking
and
tragic
the
nuns
of
the
petit
picpus
had
made
a
vault
under
their
grand
altar
for
the
burial
of
their
community
the
government
as
they
say
does
not
permit
this
vault
to
receive
coffins
so
they
leave
the
convent
when
they
die
this
is
an
affliction
to
them
and
causes
them
consternation
as
an
infraction
of
the
rules
they
had
obtained
a
mediocre
consolation
at
best
permission
to
be
interred
at
a
special
hour
and
in
a
special
corner
in
the
ancient
vaugirard
cemetery
which
was
made
of
land
which
had
formerly
belonged
to
their
community
on
fridays
the
nuns
hear
high
mass
vespers
and
all
the
offices
as
on
sunday
they
scrupulously
observe
in
addition
all
the
little
festivals
unknown
to
people
of
the
world
of
which
the
church
of
france
was
so
prodigal
in
the
olden
days
and
of
which
it
is
still
prodigal
in
spain
and
italy
their
stations
in
the
chapel
are
interminable
as
for
the
number
and
duration
of
their
prayers
we
can
convey
no
better
idea
of
them
than
by
quoting
the
ingenuous
remark
of
one
of
them
the
prayers
of
the
postulants
are
frightful
the
prayers
of
the
novices
are
still
worse
and
the
prayers
of
the
professed
nuns
are
still
worse
once
a
week
the
chapter
assembles
the
prioress
presides
the
vocal
mothers
assist
each
sister
kneels
in
turn
on
the
stones
and
confesses
aloud
in
the
presence
of
all
the
faults
and
sins
which
she
has
committed
during
the
week
the
vocal
mothers
consult
after
each
confession
and
inflict
the
penance
aloud
besides
this
confession
in
a
loud
tone
for
which
all
faults
in
the
least
serious
are
reserved
they
have
for
their
venial
offences
what
they
call
the
coulpe
to
make
one
s
coulpe
means
to
prostrate
one
s
self
flat
on
one
s
face
during
the
office
in
front
of
the
prioress
until
the
latter
who
is
never
called
anything
but
our
mother
notifies
the
culprit
by
a
slight
tap
of
her
foot
against
the
wood
of
her
stall
that
she
can
rise
the
coulpe
or
peccavi
is
made
for
a
very
small
matter
a
broken
glass
a
torn
veil
an
involuntary
delay
of
a
few
seconds
at
an
office
a
false
note
in
church
etc
this
suffices
and
the
coulpe
is
made
the
coulpe
is
entirely
spontaneous
it
is
the
culpable
person
herself
the
word
is
etymologically
in
its
place
here
who
judges
herself
and
inflicts
it
on
herself
on
festival
days
and
sundays
four
mother
precentors
intone
the
offices
before
a
large
reading
desk
with
four
places
one
day
one
of
the
mother
precentors
intoned
a
psalm
beginning
with
ecce
and
instead
of
ecce
she
uttered
aloud
the
three
notes
do
si
sol
for
this
piece
of
absent
mindedness
she
underwent
a
coulpe
which
lasted
during
the
whole
service
what
rendered
the
fault
enormous
was
the
fact
that
the
chapter
had
laughed
when
a
nun
is
summoned
to
the
parlor
even
were
it
the
prioress
herself
she
drops
her
veil
as
will
be
remembered
so
that
only
her
mouth
is
visible
the
prioress
alone
can
hold
communication
with
strangers
the
others
can
see
only
their
immediate
family
and
that
very
rarely
if
by
chance
an
outsider
presents
herself
to
see
a
nun
or
one
whom
she
has
known
and
loved
in
the
outer
world
a
regular
series
of
negotiations
is
required
if
it
is
a
woman
the
authorization
may
sometimes
be
granted
the
nun
comes
and
they
talk
to
her
through
the
shutters
which
are
opened
only
for
a
mother
or
sister
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
permission
is
always
refused
to
men
such
is
the
rule
of
saint
benoit
aggravated
by
martin
verga
these
nuns
are
not
gay
rosy
and
fresh
as
the
daughters
of
other
orders
often
are
they
are
pale
and
grave
between
1825
and
1830
three
of
them

iii
austerities
one
is
a
postulant
for
two
years
at
least
often
for

a

for

it
is
rare
that
the
definitive
vows
can
be
pronounced
earlier
than
the
age
of
twenty
three
or
twenty
four
years
the
bernardines
benedictines
of
martin
verga
do
not
admit
widows
to
their
order
in
their
cells
they
deliver
themselves
up
to
many
unknown
macerations
of
which
they
must
never
speak
on
the
day
when
a
novice
makes
her
profession
she
is
dressed
in
her
handsomest
attire
she
is
crowned
with
white
roses
her
hair
is
brushed
until
it
shines
and
curled
then
she
prostrates
herself
a
great
black
veil
is
thrown
over
her
and
the
office
for
the
dead
is
sung
then
the
nuns
separate
into
two
files
one
file
passes
close
to
her
saying
in
plaintive
accents
our
sister
is
dead
and
the
other
file
responds
in
a
voice
of
ecstasy
our
sister
is
alive
in
jesus
christ
at
the
epoch
when
this
story
takes
place
a
boarding
school
was
attached
to
the
convent
a
boarding
school
for
young
girls
of
noble
and
mostly
wealthy
families
among
whom
could
be
remarked
mademoiselle
de
saint
aulaire
and
de
belissen
and
an
english
girl
bearing
the
illustrious
catholic
name
of
talbot
these
young
girls
reared
by
these
nuns
between
four
walls
grew
up
with
a
horror
of
the
world
and
of
the
age
one
of
them
said
to
us
one
day
the
sight
of
the
street
pavement
made
me
shudder
from
head
to
foot
they
were
dressed
in
blue
with
a
white
cap
and
a
holy
spirit
of
silver
gilt
or
of
copper
on
their
breast
on
certain
grand
festival
days
particularly
saint
martha
s
day
they
were
permitted
as
a
high
favor
and
a
supreme
happiness
to
dress
themselves
as
nuns
and
to
carry
out
the
offices
and
practice
of
saint
benoit
for
a
whole
day
in
the
early
days
the
nuns
were
in
the
habit
of
lending
them
their
black
garments
this
seemed
profane
and
the
prioress
forbade
it
only
the
novices
were
permitted
to
lend
it
is
remarkable
that
these
performances
tolerated
and
encouraged
no
doubt
in
the
convent
out
of
a
secret
spirit
of
proselytism
and
in
order
to
give
these
children
a
foretaste
of
the
holy
habit
were
a
genuine
happiness
and
a
real
recreation
for
the
scholars
they
simply
amused
themselves
with
it
it
was
new
it
gave
them
a
change
candid
reasons
of
childhood
which
do
not
however
succeed
in
making
us
worldlings
comprehend
the
felicity
of
holding
a
holy
water
sprinkler
in
one
s
hand
and
standing
for
hours
together
singing
hard
enough
for
four
in
front
of
a
reading
desk
the
pupils
conformed
with
the
exception
of
the
austerities
to
all
the
practices
of
the
convent
there
was
a
certain
young
woman
who
entered
the
world
and
who
after
many
years
of
married
life
had
not
succeeded
in
breaking
herself
of
the
habit
of
saying
in
great
haste
whenever
any
one
knocked
at
her
door
forever
like
the
nuns
the
pupils
saw
their
relatives
only
in
the
parlor
their
very
mothers
did
not
obtain
permission
to
embrace
them
the
following
illustrates
to
what
a
degree
severity
on
that
point
was
carried
one
day
a
young
girl
received
a
visit
from
her
mother
who
was
accompanied
by
a
little
sister
three
years
of
age
the
young
girl
wept
for
she
wished
greatly
to
embrace
her
sister
impossible
she
begged
that
at
least
the
child
might
be
permitted
to
pass
her
little
hand
through
the
bars
so
that
she
could
kiss
it
this
was
almost
indignantly
refused
chapter
iv
gayeties
none
the
less
these
young
girls
filled
this
grave
house
with
charming
souvenirs
at
certain
hours
childhood
sparkled
in
that
cloister
the
recreation
hour
struck
a
door
swung
on
its
hinges
the
birds
said
good
here
come
the
children
an
irruption
of
youth
inundated
that
garden
intersected
with
a
cross
like
a
shroud
radiant
faces
white
foreheads
innocent
eyes
full
of
merry
light
all
sorts
of
auroras
were
scattered
about
amid
these
shadows
after
the
psalmodies
the
bells
the
peals
and
knells
and
offices
the
sound
of
these
little
girls
burst
forth
on
a
sudden
more
sweetly
than
the
noise
of
bees
the
hive
of
joy
was
opened
and
each
one
brought
her
honey
they
played
they
called
to
each
other
they
formed
into
groups
they
ran
about
pretty
little
white
teeth
chattered
in
the
corners
the
veils
superintended
the
laughs
from
a
distance
shades
kept
watch
of
the
sunbeams
but
what
mattered
it
still
they
beamed
and
laughed
those
four
lugubrious
walls
had
their
moment
of
dazzling
brilliancy
they
looked
on
vaguely
blanched
with
the
reflection
of
so
much
joy
at
this
sweet
swarming
of
the
hives
it
was
like
a
shower
of
roses
falling
athwart
this
house
of
mourning
the
young
girls
frolicked
beneath
the
eyes
of
the
nuns
the
gaze
of
impeccability
does
not
embarrass
innocence
thanks
to
these
children
there
was
among
so
many
austere
hours
one
hour
of
ingenuousness
the
little
ones
skipped
about
the
elder
ones
danced
in
this
cloister
play
was
mingled
with
heaven
nothing
is
so
delightful
and
so
august
as
all
these
fresh
expanding
young
souls
homer
would
have
come
thither
to
laugh
with
perrault
and
there
was
in
that
black
garden
youth
health
noise
cries
giddiness
pleasure
happiness
enough
to
smooth
out
the
wrinkles
of
all
their
ancestresses
those
of
the
epic
as
well
as
those
of
the
fairy
tale
those
of
the
throne
as
well
as
those
of
the
thatched
cottage
from
hecuba
to
la
mere
grand
in
that
house
more
than
anywhere
else
perhaps
arise
those
children
s
sayings
which
are
so
graceful
and
which
evoke
a
smile
that
is
full
of
thoughtfulness
it
was
between
those
four
gloomy
walls
that
a
child
of
five
years
exclaimed
one
day
mother
one
of
the
big
girls
has
just
told
me
that
i
have
only
nine
years
and
ten
months
longer
to
remain
here
what
happiness
it
was
here
too
that
this
memorable
dialogue
took
place
a
vocal
mother
why
are
you
weeping
my
child
the
child
aged
six
i
told
alix
that
i
knew
my
french
history
she
says
that
i
do
not
know
it
but
i
do
alix
the
big
girl
aged
nine
no
she
does
not
know
it
the
mother
how
is
that
my
child
alix
she
told
me
to
open
the
book
at
random
and
to
ask
her
any
question
in
the
book
and
she
would
answer
it
well
she
did
not
answer
it
let
us
see
about
it
what
did
you
ask
her
i
opened
the
book
at
random
as
she
proposed
and
i
put
the
first
question
that
i
came
across
and
what
was
the
question
it
was
what
happened
after
that
it
was
there
that
that
profound
remark
was
made
anent
a
rather
greedy
paroquet
which
belonged
to
a
lady
boarder
how
well
bred
it
eats
the
top
of
the
slice
of
bread
and
butter
just
like
a
person
it
was
on
one
of
the
flagstones
of
this
cloister
that
there
was
once
picked
up
a
confession
which
had
been
written
out
in
advance
in
order
that
she
might
not
forget
it
by
a
sinner
of
seven
years
father
i
accuse
myself
of
having
been
avaricious
father
i
accuse
myself
of
having
been
an
adulteress
father
i
accuse
myself
of
having
raised
my
eyes
to
the
gentlemen
it
was
on
one
of
the
turf
benches
of
this
garden
that
a
rosy
mouth
six
years
of
age
improvised
the
following
tale
which
was
listened
to
by
blue
eyes
aged
four
and
five
years
there
were
three
little
cocks
who
owned
a
country
where
there
were
a
great
many
flowers
they
plucked
the
flowers
and
put
them
in
their
pockets
after
that
they
plucked
the
leaves
and
put
them
in
their
playthings
there
was
a
wolf
in
that
country
there
was
a
great
deal
of
forest
and
the
wolf
was
in
the
forest
and
he
ate
the
little
cocks
and
this
other
poem
there
came
a
blow
with
a
stick
it
was
punchinello
who
bestowed
it
on
the
cat
it
was
not
good
for
her
it
hurt
her
then
a
lady
put
punchinello
in
prison
it
was
there
that
a
little
abandoned
child
a
foundling
whom
the
convent
was
bringing
up
out
of
charity
uttered
this
sweet
and
heart
breaking
saying
she
heard
the
others
talking
of
their
mothers
and
she
murmured
in
her
corner
as
for
me
my
mother
was
not
there
when
i
was
born
there
was
a
stout
portress
who
could
always
be
seen
hurrying
through
the
corridors
with
her
bunch
of
keys
and
whose
name
was
sister
agatha
the
big

girls
those
over
ten
years
of
age
called
her
agathocles
the
refectory
a
large
apartment
of
an
oblong
square
form
which
received
no
light
except
through
a
vaulted
cloister
on
a
level
with
the
garden
was
dark
and
damp
and
as
the
children
say
full
of
beasts
all
the
places
round
about
furnished
their
contingent
of
insects
each
of
its
four
corners
had
received
in
the
language
of
the
pupils
a
special
and
expressive
name
there
was

near
the
kitchen
and
was

was
not
so
cold
there
as
elsewhere
from
the
refectory
the
names
had
passed
to
the
boarding
school
and
there
served
as
in
the
old
college
mazarin
to
distinguish
four
nations
every
pupil
belonged
to
one
of
these
four
nations
according
to
the
corner
of
the
refectory
in
which
she
sat
at
meals
one
day
monseigneur
the
archbishop
while
making
his
pastoral
visit
saw
a
pretty
little
rosy
girl
with
beautiful
golden
hair
enter
the
class
room
through
which
he
was
passing
he
inquired
of
another
pupil
a
charming
brunette
with
rosy
cheeks
who
stood
near
him
who
is
that
she
is
a
spider
monseigneur

is

was
one
of
those
strict
and
graceful
places
where
young
girls
pass
their
childhood
in
a
shadow
that
is
almost
august
at
ecouen
in
order
to
take
rank
in
the
procession
of
the
holy
sacrament
a
distinction
was
made
between
virgins
and
florists

were
also
the
dais

the
censors

who
held
the
cords
of
the
dais
and
the
others
who
carried
incense
before
the
holy
sacrament
the
flowers
belonged
by
right
to
the
florists
four
virgins
walked
in
advance
on
the
morning
of
that
great
day
it
was
no
rare
thing
to
hear
the
question
put
in
the
dormitory
who
is
a
virgin
madame
campan
used
to
quote
this
saying
of
a
little
one
of
seven
years
to
a
big
girl
of
sixteen
who
took
the
head
of
the
procession

remained
at
the
rear

this
prayer
which
was
called

which
possessed
the
property
of
bearing
people
straight
to

was
inscribed

this
characteristic
orison
had
disappeared
from
the
wall
under
a
triple
coating
of
daubing
paint
at
the
present
time
it
is
finally
disappearing
from
the
memories
of
several
who
were
young
girls
then
and
who
are
old
women
now
a
large
crucifix
fastened
to
the
wall
completed
the
decoration
of
this
refectory
whose
only
door
as
we
think
we
have
mentioned
opened
on
the
garden
two
narrow
tables
each
flanked
by
two
wooden
benches
formed
two
long
parallel
lines
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
refectory
the
walls
were
white
the
tables
were
black
these
two
mourning
colors
constitute
the
only
variety
in
convents
the
meals
were
plain
and
the
food
of
the
children
themselves
severe
a
single
dish
of
meat
and
vegetables
combined
or
salt
fish
such
was
their
luxury
this
meagre
fare
which
was
reserved
for
the
pupils
alone
was
nevertheless
an
exception
the
children
ate
in
silence
under
the
eye
of
the
mother
whose
turn
it
was
who
if
a
fly
took
a
notion
to
fly
or
to
hum
against
the
rule
opened
and
shut
a
wooden
book
from
time
to
time
this
silence
was
seasoned
with
the
lives
of
the
saints
read
aloud
from
a
little
pulpit
with
a
desk
which
was
situated
at
the
foot
of
the
crucifix
the
reader
was
one
of
the
big
girls
in
weekly
turn
at
regular
distances
on
the
bare
tables
there
were
large
varnished
bowls
in
which
the
pupils
washed
their
own
silver
cups
and
knives
and
forks
and
into
which
they
sometimes
threw
some
scrap
of
tough
meat
or
spoiled
fish
this
was
punished
these
bowls
were
called
ronds
d
eau
the
child
who
broke
the
silence
made
a
cross
with
her
tongue
where
on
the
ground
she
licked
the
pavement
the
dust
that
end
of
all
joys
was
charged
with
the
chastisement
of
those
poor
little
rose
leaves
which
had
been
guilty
of
chirping
there
was
in
the
convent
a
book
which
has
never
been
printed
except
as
a
unique
copy
and
which
it
is
forbidden
to
read
it
is

rule
of

benoit

arcanum
which
no
profane
eye
must
penetrate
nemo

the
pupils
one
day
succeeded
in
getting
possession
of
this
book
and
set
to
reading
it
with
avidity
a
reading
which
was
often
interrupted
by
the
fear
of
being
caught
which
caused
them
to
close
the
volume
precipitately
from
the
great
danger
thus
incurred
they
derived
but
a
very
moderate
amount
of
pleasure
the
most
interesting
thing
they
found
were
some
unintelligible
pages
about
the
sins
of
young
boys
they
played
in
an
alley
of
the
garden
bordered
with
a
few
shabby
fruit
trees
in
spite
of
the
extreme
surveillance
and
the
severity
of
the
punishments
administered
when
the
wind
had
shaken
the
trees
they
sometimes
succeeded
in
picking
up
a
green
apple
or
a
spoiled
apricot
or
an
inhabited
pear
on
the
sly
i
will
now
cede
the
privilege
of
speech
to
a
letter
which
lies
before
me
a
letter
written
five
and
twenty
years
ago
by
an
old
pupil
now
madame
la
duchesse
de
one
of
the
most
elegant
women
in
paris
i
quote
literally
one
hides
one
s
pear
or
one
s
apple
as
best
one
may
when
one
goes
up
stairs
to
put
the
veil
on
the
bed
before
supper
one
stuffs
them
under
one
s
pillow
and
at
night
one
eats
them
in
bed
and
when
one
cannot
do
that
one
eats
them
in
the
closet
that
was
one
of
their
greatest
luxuries
once
it
was
at
the
epoch
of
the
visit
from
the
archbishop
to
the
convent
one
of
the
young
girls
mademoiselle
bouchard
who
was
connected
with
the
montmorency
family
laid
a
wager
that
she
would
ask
for
a
day
s
leave
of
absence
an
enormity
in
so
austere
a
community
the
wager
was
accepted
but
not
one
of
those
who
bet
believed
that
she
would
do
it
when
the
moment
came
as
the
archbishop
was
passing
in
front
of
the
pupils
mademoiselle
bouchard
to
the
indescribable
terror
of
her
companions
stepped
out
of
the
ranks
and
said
monseigneur
a
day
s
leave
of
absence
mademoiselle
bouchard
was
tall
blooming
with
the
prettiest
little
rosy
face
in
the
world
m
de
quelen
smiled
and
said
what
my
dear
child
a
day
s
leave
of
absence
three
days
if
you
like
i
grant
you
three
days
the
prioress
could
do
nothing
the
archbishop
had
spoken
horror
of
the
convent
but
joy
of
the
pupil
the
effect
may
be
imagined
this
stern
cloister
was
not
so
well
walled
off
however
but
that
the
life
of
the
passions
of
the
outside
world
drama
and
even
romance
did
not
make
their
way
in
to
prove
this
we
will
confine
ourselves
to
recording
here
and
to
briefly
mentioning
a
real
and
incontestable
fact
which
however
bears
no
reference
in
itself
to
and
is
not
connected
by
any
thread
whatever
with
the
story
which
we
are
relating
we
mention
the
fact
for
the
sake
of
completing
the
physiognomy
of
the
convent
in
the
reader
s
mind
about
this
time
there
was
in
the
convent
a
mysterious
person
who
was
not
a
nun
who
was
treated
with
great
respect
and
who
was
addressed
as
madame
albertine
nothing
was
known
about
her
save
that
she
was
mad
and
that
in
the
world
she
passed
for
dead
beneath
this
history
it
was
said
there
lay
the
arrangements
of
fortune
necessary
for
a
great
marriage
this
woman
hardly
thirty
years
of
age
of
dark
complexion
and
tolerably
pretty
had
a
vague
look
in
her
large
black
eyes
could
she
see
there
was
some
doubt
about
this
she
glided
rather
than
walked
she
never
spoke
it
was
not
quite
known
whether
she
breathed
her
nostrils
were
livid
and
pinched
as
after
yielding
up
their
last
sigh
to
touch
her
hand
was
like
touching
snow
she
possessed
a
strange
spectral
grace
wherever
she
entered
people
felt
cold
one
day
a
sister
on
seeing
her
pass
said
to
another
sister
she
passes
for
a
dead
woman
perhaps
she
is
one
replied
the
other
a
hundred
tales
were
told
of
madame
albertine
this
arose
from
the
eternal
curiosity
of
the
pupils
in
the
chapel
there
was
a
gallery
called
l
oeil
de
boeuf
it
was
in
this
gallery
which
had
only
a
circular
bay
an
oeil
de
boeuf
that
madame
albertine
listened
to
the
offices
she
always
occupied
it
alone
because
from
this
gallery
being
on
the
level
of
the
first
story
the
preacher
or
the
officiating
priest
could
be
seen
which
was
interdicted
to
the
nuns
one
day
the
pulpit
was
occupied
by
a
young
priest
of
high
rank
m
le
duc
de
rohan
peer
of
france
officer
of
the
red
musketeers
in
1815
when
he
was
prince
de
leon
and
who
died
afterward
in
1830
as
cardinal
and
archbishop
of
besancon
it
was
the
first
time
that
m
de
rohan
had
preached
at
the
petit
picpus
convent
madame
albertine
usually
preserved
perfect
calmness
and
complete
immobility
during
the
sermons
and
services
that
day
as
soon
as
she
caught
sight
of
m
de
rohan
she
half
rose
and
said
in
a
loud
voice
amid
the
silence
of
the
chapel
ah
auguste
the
whole
community
turned
their
heads
in
amazement
the
preacher
raised
his
eyes
but
madame
albertine
had
relapsed
into
her
immobility
a
breath
from
the
outer
world
a
flash
of
life
had
passed
for
an
instant
across
that
cold
and
lifeless
face
and
had
then
vanished
and
the
mad
woman
had
become
a
corpse
again
those
two
words
however
had
set
every
one
in
the
convent
who
had
the
privilege
of
speech
to
chattering
how
many
things
were
contained
in
that
ah
auguste
what
revelations
m
de
rohan
s
name
really
was
auguste
it
was
evident
that
madame
albertine
belonged
to
the
very
highest
society
since
she
knew
m
de
rohan
and
that
her
own
rank
there
was
of
the
highest
since
she
spoke
thus
familiarly
of
so
great
a
lord
and
that
there
existed
between
them
some
connection
of
relationship
perhaps
but
a
very
close
one
in
any
case
since
she
knew
his
pet
name
two
very
severe
duchesses
mesdames
de
choiseul
and
de
serent
often
visited
the
community
whither
they
penetrated
no
doubt
in
virtue
of
the
privilege
magnates
mulieres
and
caused
great
consternation
in
the
boarding
school
when
these
two
old
ladies
passed
by
all
the
poor
young
girls
trembled
and
dropped
their
eyes
moreover
m
de
rohan
quite
unknown
to
himself
was
an
object
of
attention
to
the
school
girls
at
that
epoch
he
had
just
been
made
while
waiting
for
the
episcopate
vicar
general
of
the
archbishop
of
paris
it
was
one
of
his
habits
to
come
tolerably
often
to
celebrate
the
offices
in
the
chapel
of
the
nuns
of
the
petit
picpus
not
one
of
the
young
recluses
could
see
him
because
of
the
serge
curtain
but
he
had
a
sweet
and
rather
shrill
voice
which
they
had
come
to
know
and
to
distinguish
he
had
been
a
mousquetaire
and
then
he
was
said
to
be
very
coquettish
that
his
handsome
brown
hair
was
very
well
dressed
in
a
roll
around
his
head
and
that
he
had
a
broad
girdle
of
magnificent
moire
and
that
his
black
cassock
was
of
the
most
elegant
cut
in
the
world
he
held
a
great
place
in
all
these
imaginations
of
sixteen
years
not
a
sound
from
without
made
its
way
into
the
convent
but
there
was
one
year
when
the
sound
of
a
flute
penetrated
thither
this
was
an
event
and
the
girls
who
were
at
school
there
at
the
time
still
recall
it
it
was
a
flute
which
was
played
in
the
neighborhood
this
flute
always
played
the
same
air
an
air
which
is
very
far
away
nowadays
my
zetulbe
come
reign
o
er
my
soul
and
it
was
heard
two
or
three
times
a
day
the
young
girls
passed
hours
in
listening
to
it
the
vocal
mothers
were
upset
by
it
brains
were
busy
punishments
descended
in
showers
this
lasted
for
several
months
the
girls
were
all
more
or
less
in
love
with
the
unknown
musician
each
one
dreamed
that
she
was
zetulbe
the
sound
of
the
flute
proceeded
from
the
direction
of
the
rue
droit
mur
and
they
would
have
given
anything
compromised
everything
attempted
anything
for
the
sake
of
seeing
of
catching
a
glance
if
only
for
a
second
of
the
young
man
who
played
that
flute
so
deliciously
and
who
no
doubt
played
on
all
these
souls
at
the
same
time
there
were
some
who
made
their
escape
by
a
back
door
and
ascended
to
the
third
story
on
the
rue
droit
mur
side
in
order
to
attempt
to
catch
a
glimpse
through
the
gaps
impossible
one
even
went
so
far
as
to
thrust
her
arm
through
the
grating
and
to
wave
her
white
handkerchief
two
were
still
bolder
they
found
means
to
climb
on
a
roof
and
risked
their
lives
there
and
succeeded
at
last
in
seeing
the
young
man
he
was
an
old
emigre
gentleman
blind
and
penniless
who
was
playing
his
flute
in
his
attic

the
little
convent
in
this
enclosure
of
the
petit

there
were
three
perfectly
distinct
buildings
the
great
convent
inhabited
by
the
nuns
the
boarding
school
where
the
scholars
were
lodged
and
lastly
what
was
called
the
little
convent
it
was
a
building
with
a
garden
in
which
lived
all
sorts
of
aged
nuns
of
various
orders
the
relics
of
cloisters
destroyed
in
the
revolution
a
reunion
of
all
the
black
gray
and
white
medleys
of
all
communities
and
all
possible
varieties
what
might
be
called
if
such
a
coupling
of
words
is
permissible
a
sort
of
harlequin
convent
when
the
empire
was
established
all
these
poor
old
dispersed
and
exiled
women
had
been
accorded
permission
to
come
and
take
shelter
under
the
wings
of
the
bernardines
benedictines
the
government
paid
them
a
small
pension
the
ladies
of
the
petit
picpus
received
them
cordially
it
was
a
singular
pell

each
followed
her
own
rule
sometimes
the
pupils
of
the
boarding
school
were
allowed
as
a
great
recreation
to
pay
them
a
visit
the
result
is
that
all
those
young
memories
have
retained
among
other
souvenirs
that
of
mother
sainte
bazile
mother
sainte
scolastique
and
mother
jacob
one
of
these
refugees
found
herself
almost
at
home
she
was
a
nun
of
sainte

the
only
one
of
her
order
who
had
survived
the
ancient
convent
of
the
ladies
of
sainte
aure
occupied
at
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
this
very
house
of
the
petit
picpus
which
belonged
later
to
the
benedictines
of
martin
verga
this
holy
woman
too
poor
to
wear
the
magnificent
habit
of
her
order
which
was
a
white
robe
with
a
scarlet
scapulary
had
piously
put
it
on
a
little
manikin
which
she
exhibited
with
complacency
and
which
she
bequeathed
to
the
house
at
her
death
in
1824
only
one
nun
of
this
order
remained
to
day
there
remains
only
a
doll
in
addition
to
these
worthy
mothers
some
old
society
women
had
obtained
permission
of
the
prioress
like
madame
albertine
to
retire
into
the
little
convent
among
the
number
were
madame
beaufort
d
hautpoul
and
marquise
dufresne
another
was
never
known
in
the
convent
except
by
the
formidable
noise
which
she
made
when
she
blew
her
nose
the
pupils
called
her
madame
vacarmini

about
1820
or
1821
madame
de
genlis
who
was
at
that
time
editing
a
little
periodical
publication
called
l

asked
to
be
allowed
to
enter
the
convent
of
the
petit
picpus
as
lady
resident
the
duc
d
orleans
recommended
her
uproar
in
the
hive
the
vocal
mothers
were
all
in
a
flutter
madame
de
genlis
had
made
romances
but
she
declared
that
she
was
the
first
to
detest
them
and
then
she
had
reached
her
fierce
stage
of
devotion
with
the
aid
of
god
and
of
the
prince
she
entered
she
departed
at
the
end
of
six
or
eight
months
alleging
as
a
reason
that
there
was
no
shade
in
the
garden
the
nuns
were
delighted
although
very
old
she
still
played
the
harp
and
did
it
very
well
when
she
went
away
she
left
her
mark
in
her
cell
madame
de

was
superstitious
and
a
latinist
these
two
words
furnish
a
tolerably
good
profile
of
her
a
few
years
ago
there
were
still
to
be
seen
pasted
in
the
inside
of

cupboard
in

of
course
common
to

the

the
public
was
even
admitted
by

but
all
was
so
arranged
that
none
of
the
inhabitants
of

could
see
a

suppose
a

whose

in

gigantic
hand
and
folded
in
such
a
manner
as
to
form
not

ansiaux
whom
the
letter
of
which
we
have
perused
a
few
lines
calls
m
anciot
and
describes
as
a
frightful
old
hunchback
it
will
be
seen
that
all
these
men
were
carefully
chosen
such
was
this
curious
house
chapter

post
corda
lapides
after
having
sketched
its
moral
face
it
will
not
prove
unprofitable
to
point
out
in
a
few
words
its
material
configuration
the
reader
already
has
some
idea
of
it
the
convent
of
the
petit
picpus
sainte
antoine
filled
almost
the
whole
of
the
vast
trapezium
which
resulted
from
the
intersection
of
the
rue
polonceau
the
rue
droit
mur
the
rue
petit
picpus
and
the
unused
lane
called
rue
aumarais
on
old
plans
these
four
streets
surrounded
this
trapezium
like
a
moat
the
convent
was
composed
of
several
buildings
and
a
garden
the
principal
building
taken
in
its
entirety
was
a
juxtaposition
of
hybrid
constructions
which
viewed
from
a
bird
s
eye
view
outlined
with
considerable
exactness
a
gibbet
laid
flat
on
the
ground
the
main
arm
of
the
gibbet
occupied
the
whole
of
the
fragment
of
the
rue
droit
mur
comprised
between
the
rue
petit
picpus
and
the
rue
polonceau
the
lesser
arm
was
a
lofty
gray
severe
grated
facade
which
faced
the
rue
petit
picpus
the
carriage
entrance
no
62
marked
its
extremity
towards
the
centre
of
this
facade
was
a
low
arched
door
whitened
with
dust
and
ashes
where
the
spiders
wove
their
webs
and
which
was
open
only
for
an
hour
or
two
on
sundays
and
on
rare
occasions
when
the
coffin
of
a
nun
left
the
convent
this
was
the
public
entrance
of
the
church
the
elbow
of
the
gibbet
was
a
square
hall
which
was
used
as
the
servants
hall
and
which
the
nuns
called
the
buttery
in
the
main
arm
were
the
cells
of
the
mothers
the
sisters
and
the
novices
in
the
lesser
arm
lay
the
kitchens
the
refectory
backed
up
by
the
cloisters
and
the
church
between
the
door
no
62
and
the
corner
of
the
closed
lane
aumarais
was
the
school
which
was
not
visible
from
without
the
remainder
of
the
trapezium
formed
the
garden
which
was
much
lower
than
the
level
of
the
rue
polonceau
which
caused
the
walls
to
be
very
much
higher
on
the
inside
than
on
the
outside
the
garden
which
was
slightly
arched
had
in
its
centre
on
the
summit
of
a
hillock
a
fine
pointed
and
conical
fir
tree
whence
ran
as
from
the
peaked
boss
of
a
shield
four
grand
alleys
and
ranged
by
twos
in
between
the
branchings
of
these
eight
small
ones
so
that
if
the
enclosure
had
been
circular
the
geometrical
plan
of
the
alleys
would
have
resembled
a
cross
superposed
on
a
wheel
as
the
alleys
all
ended
in
the
very
irregular
walls
of
the
garden
they
were
of
unequal
length
they
were
bordered
with
currant
bushes
at
the
bottom
an
alley
of
tall
poplars
ran
from
the
ruins
of
the
old
convent
which
was
at
the
angle
of
the
rue
droit
mur
to
the
house
of
the
little
convent
which
was
at
the
angle
of
the
aumarais
lane
in
front
of
the
little
convent
was
what
was
called
the
little
garden
to
this
whole
let
the
reader
add
a
courtyard
all
sorts
of
varied
angles
formed
by
the
interior
buildings
prison
walls
the
long
black
line
of
roofs
which
bordered
the
other
side
of
the
rue
polonceau
for
its
sole
perspective
and
neighborhood
and
he
will
be
able
to
form
for
himself
a
complete
image
of
what
the
house
of
the
bernardines
of
the
petit
picpus
was
forty
years
ago
this
holy
house
had
been
built
on
the
precise
site
of
a
famous
tennis
ground
of
the
fourteenth
to
the
sixteenth
century
which
was
called
the
tennis
ground
of
the
eleven
thousand
devils
all
these
streets
moreover
were
more
ancient
than
paris
these
names
droit
mur
and
aumarais
are
very
ancient
the
streets
which
bear
them
are
very
much
more
ancient
still
aumarais
lane
was
called
maugout
lane
the
rue
droit

was
called
the
rue

chapter
ix
a
century
under
a
guimpe
since
we
are
engaged
in
giving
details
as
to
what
the
convent
of
the
petit
picpus
was
in
former
times
and
since
we
have
ventured
to
open
a
window
on
that
discreet
retreat
the
reader
will
permit
us
one
other
little
digression
utterly
foreign
to
this
book
but
characteristic
and
useful
since
it
shows
that
the
cloister
even
has
its
original
figures
in
the
little
convent
there
was
a
centenarian
who
came
from
the
abbey
of
fontevrault
she
had
even
been
in
society
before
the
revolution
she
talked
a
great
deal
of
m
de
miromesnil
keeper
of
the
seals
under
louis
xvi
and
of
a
presidentess
duplat
with
whom
she
had
been
very
intimate
it
was
her
pleasure
and
her
vanity
to
drag
in
these
names
on
every
pretext
she
told
wonders
of
the
abbey
of
fontevrault
that
it
was
like
a
city
and
that
there
were
streets
in
the
monastery
she
talked
with
a
picard
accent
which
amused
the
pupils
every
year
she
solemnly
renewed
her
vows
and
at
the
moment
of
taking
the
oath
she
said
to
the
priest
monseigneur
saint
franã
ois
gave
it
to
monseigneur
saint
julien
monseigneur
saint
julien
gave
it
to
monseigneur
saint
eusebius
monseigneur
saint
eusebius
gave
it
to
monseigneur
saint
procopius
etc
etc
and
thus
i
give
it
to
you
father
and
the
school
girls
would
begin
to
laugh
not
in
their
sleeves
but
under
their
veils
charming
little
stifled
laughs
which
made
the
vocal
mothers
frown
on
another
occasion
the
centenarian
was
telling
stories
she
said
that
in
her
youth
the
bernardine
monks
were
every
whit
as
good
as
the
mousquetaires
it
was
a
century
which
spoke
through
her
but
it
was
the
eighteenth
century
she
told
about
the
custom
of
the
four
wines
which
existed
before
the
revolution
in
champagne
and
bourgogne
when
a
great
personage
a
marshal
of
france
a
prince
a
duke
and
a
peer
traversed
a
town
in
burgundy
or
champagne
the
city
fathers
came
out
to
harangue
him
and
presented
him
with
four
silver
gondolas
into
which
they
had
poured
four
different
sorts
of
wine
on
the
first
goblet
this
inscription
could
be
read
monkey
wine
on
the
second
lion
wine
on
the
third
sheep
wine
on
the
fourth
hog
wine
these
four
legends
express
the
four
stages
descended
by
the
drunkard
the
first
intoxication
which
enlivens
the
second
that
which
irritates
the
third
that
which
dulls
and
the
fourth
that
which
brutalizes
in
a
cupboard
under
lock
and
key
she
kept
a
mysterious
object
of
which
she
thought
a
great
deal
the
rule
of
fontevrault
did
not
forbid
this
she
would
not
show
this
object
to
anyone
she
shut
herself
up
which
her
rule
allowed
her
to
do
and
hid
herself
every
time
that
she
desired
to
contemplate
it
if
she
heard
a
footstep
in
the
corridor
she
closed
the
cupboard
again
as
hastily
as
it
was
possible
with
her
aged
hands
as
soon
as
it
was
mentioned
to
her
she
became
silent
she
who
was
so
fond
of
talking
the
most
curious
were
baffled
by
her
silence
and
the
most
tenacious
by
her
obstinacy
thus
it
furnished
a
subject
of
comment
for
all
those
who
were
unoccupied
or
bored
in
the
convent
what
could
that
treasure
of
the
centenarian
be
which
was
so
precious
and
so
secret
some
holy
book
no
doubt
some
unique
chaplet
some
authentic
relic
they
lost
themselves
in
conjectures
when
the
poor
old
woman
died
they
rushed
to
her
cupboard
more
hastily
than
was
fitting
perhaps
and
opened
it
they
found
the
object
beneath
a
triple
linen
cloth
like
some
consecrated
paten
it
was
a
faenza
platter
representing
little
loves
flitting
away
pursued
by
apothecary
lads
armed
with
enormous
syringes
the
chase
abounds
in
grimaces
and
in
comical
postures
one
of
the
charming
little
loves
is
already
fairly
spitted
he
is
resisting
fluttering
his
tiny
wings
and
still
making
an
effort
to
fly
but
the
dancer
is
laughing
with
a
satanical
air
moral
love
conquered
by
the
colic
this
platter
which
is
very
curious
and
which
had
possibly
the
honor
of
furnishing
moliere
with
an
idea
was
still
in
existence
in
september
1845
it
was
for
sale
by
a
bric
a
brac
merchant
in
the
boulevard
beaumarchais
this
good
old
woman
would
not
receive
any
visits
from
outside
because
said
she
the
parlor
is
too
gloomy
chapter
x
origin
of
the
perpetual
adoration
however
this
almost
sepulchral
parlor
of
which
we
have
sought
to
convey
an
idea
is
a
purely
local
trait
which
is
not
reproduced
with
the
same
severity
in
other
convents
at
the
convent
of
the
rue
du
temple
in
particular
which
belonged
in
truth
to
another
order
the
black
shutters
were
replaced
by
brown
curtains
and
the
parlor
itself
was
a
salon
with
a
polished
wood
floor
whose
windows
were
draped
in
white
muslin
curtains
and
whose
walls
admitted
all
sorts
of
frames
a
portrait
of
a
benedictine
nun
with
unveiled
face
painted
bouquets
and
even
the
head
of
a
turk
it
is
in
that
garden
of
the
temple
convent
that
stood
that
famous
chestnut
tree
which
was
renowned
as
the
finest
and
the
largest
in
france
and
which
bore
the
reputation
among
the
good
people
of
the
eighteenth
century
of
being
the
father
of
all
the
chestnut
trees
of
the
realm
as
we
have
said
this
convent
of
the
temple
was
occupied
by
benedictines
of
the
perpetual
adoration
benedictines
quite
different
from
those
who
depended
on
citeaux
this
order
of
the
perpetual
adoration
is
not
very
ancient
and
does
not
go
back
more
than
two
hundred
years
in
1649
the
holy
sacrament
was
profaned
on
two
occasions
a
few
days
apart
in
two
churches
in
paris
at
saint
sulpice
and
at
saint
jean
en
greve
a
rare
and
frightful
sacrilege
which
set
the
whole
town
in
an
uproar
m
the
prior
and
vicar
general
of
saint
germain
des
pres
ordered
a
solemn
procession
of
all
his
clergy
in
which
the
pope
s
nuncio
officiated
but
this
expiation
did
not
satisfy
two
sainted
women
madame
courtin
marquise
de
boucs
and
the
comtesse
de
chateauvieux
this
outrage
committed
on
the
most
holy
sacrament
of
the
altar
though
but
temporary
would
not
depart
from
these
holy
souls
and
it
seemed
to
them
that
it
could
only
be
extenuated
by
a
perpetual
adoration
in
some
female
monastery
both
of
them
one
in
1652
the
other
in
1653
made
donations
of
notable
sums
to
mother
catherine
de
bar
called
of
the
holy
sacrament
a
benedictine
nun
for
the
purpose
of
founding
to
this
pious
end
a
monastery
of
the
order
of
saint
benoit
the
first
permission
for
this
foundation
was
given
to
mother
catherine
de
bar
by
m
de
metz
abbe
of
saint
germain
on
condition
that
no
woman
could
be
received
unless
she
contributed
three
hundred
livres
income
which
amounts
to
six
thousand
livres
to
the
principal
after
the
abbe
of
saint
germain
the
king
accorded
letters
patent
and
all
the
rest
abbatial
charter
and
royal
letters
was
confirmed
in
1654
by
the
chamber
of
accounts
and
the
parliament
such
is
the
origin
of
the
legal
consecration
of
the
establishment
of
the
benedictines
of
the
perpetual
adoration
of
the
holy
sacrament
at
paris
their
first
convent
was
a
new
building
in
the
rue
cassette
out
of
the
contributions
of
mesdames
de
boucs
and
de
chateauvieux
this
order
as
it
will
be
seen
was
not
to
be
confounded
with
the
benedictine
nuns
of
citeaux
it
mounted
back
to
the
abbe
of
saint
germain
des
pres
in
the
same
manner
that
the
ladies
of
the
sacred
heart
go
back
to
the
general
of
the
jesuits
and
the
sisters
of
charity
to
the
general
of
the
lazarists
it
was
also
totally
different
from
the
bernardines
of
the
petit
picpus
whose
interior
we
have
just
shown
in
1657
pope
alexander
vii
had
authorized
by
a
special
brief
the
bernardines
of
the
rue
petit
picpus
to
practise
the
perpetual
adoration
like
the
benedictine
nuns
of
the
holy
sacrament
but
the
two
orders
remained
distinct
none
the
less
chapter
xi
end
of
the
petit
picpus
at
the
beginning
of
the
restoration
the
convent
of
the
petit
picpus
was
in
its
decay
this
forms
a
part
of
the
general
death
of
the
order
which
after
the
eighteenth
century
has
been
disappearing
like
all
the
religious
orders
contemplation
is
like
prayer
one
of
humanity
s
needs
but
like
everything
which
the
revolution
touched
it
will
be
transformed
and
from
being
hostile
to
social
progress
it
will
become
favorable
to
it
the
house
of
the
petit
picpus
was
becoming
rapidly
depopulated
in
1840
the
little
convent
had
disappeared
the
school
had
disappeared
there
were
no
longer
any
old
women
nor
young
girls
the
first
were
dead
the
latter
had
taken
their
departure
volaverunt
the
rule
of
the
perpetual
adoration
is
so
rigid
in
its
nature
that
it
alarms
vocations
recoil
before
it
the
order
receives
no
recruits
in
1845
it
still
obtained
lay
sisters
here
and
there
but
of
professed
nuns
none
at
all
forty
years
ago
the
nuns
numbered
nearly
a
hundred
fifteen
years
ago
there
were
not
more
than
twenty
eight
of
them
how
many
are
there
to
day
in
1847
the
prioress
was
young
a
sign
that
the
circle
of
choice
was
restricted
she
was
not
forty
years
old
in
proportion
as
the
number
diminishes
the
fatigue
increases
the
service
of
each
becomes
more
painful
the
moment
could
then
be
seen
drawing
near
when
there
would
be
but
a
dozen
bent
and
aching
shoulders
to
bear
the
heavy
rule
of
saint
benoit
the
burden
is
implacable
and
remains
the
same
for
the
few
as
for
the
many
it
weighs
down
it
crushes
thus
they
die
at
the
period
when
the
author
of
this
book
still
lived
in
paris
two
died
one
was
twenty
five
years
old
the
other
twenty
three
this
latter
can
say
like
julia
alpinula
hic
jaceo
vixi
annos
viginti
et
tres
it
is
in
consequence
of
this
decay
that
the
convent
gave
up
the
education
of
girls
we
have
not
felt
able
to
pass
before
this
extraordinary
house
without
entering
it
and
without
introducing
the
minds
which
accompany
us
and
which
are
listening
to
our
tale
to
the
profit
of
some
perchance
of
the
melancholy
history
of
jean
valjean
we
have
penetrated
into
this
community
full
of
those
old
practices
which
seem
so
novel
to
day
it
is
the
closed
garden
hortus
conclusus
we
have
spoken
of
this
singular
place
in
detail
but
with
respect
in
so
far
at
least
as
detail
and
respect
are
compatible
we
do
not
understand
all
but
we
insult
nothing
we
are
equally
far
removed
from
the
hosanna
of
joseph
de
maistre
who
wound
up
by
anointing
the
executioner
and
from
the
sneer
of
voltaire
who
even
goes
so
far
as
to
ridicule
the
cross
an
illogical
act
on
voltaire
s
part
we
may
remark
by
the
way
for
voltaire
would
have
defended
jesus
as
he
defended
calas
and
even
for
those
who
deny
superhuman
incarnations
what
does
the
crucifix
represent
the
assassinated
sage
in
this
nineteenth
century
the
religious
idea
is
undergoing
a
crisis
people
are
unlearning
certain
things
and
they
do
well
provided
that
while
unlearning
them
they
learn
this
there
is
no
vacuum
in
the
human
heart
certain
demolitions
take
place
and
it
is
well
that
they
do
but
on
condition
that
they
are
followed
by
reconstructions
in
the
meantime
let
us
study
things
which
are
no
more
it
is
necessary
to
know
them
if
only
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
them
the
counterfeits
of
the
past
assume
false
names
and
gladly
call
themselves
the
future
this
spectre
this
past

falsifying
its

let
us
inform
ourselves
of
the
trap
let
us
be
on
our
guard
the

has
a
visage
superstition
and
a

hypocrisy
let
us
denounce
the
visage
and
let
us
tear
off
the
mask
as
for
convents
they
present
a
complex
problem
a
question
of
civilization
which
condemns
them
a
question
of
liberty
which

the
convent
as
an
abstract
idea
this
book
is
a
drama
whose
leading
personage
is
the
infinite
man
is
the
second
such
being
the
case
and
a
convent
having
happened
to
be
on
our
road
it
has
been
our
duty
to
enter
it
why
because
the
convent
which
is
common
to
the
orient
as
well
as
to
the
occident
to
antiquity
as
well
as
to
modern
times
to
paganism
to
buddhism
to
mahometanism
as
well
as
to
christianity
is
one
of
the
optical
apparatuses
applied
by
man
to
the
infinite
this
is
not
the
place
for
enlarging
disproportionately
on
certain
ideas
nevertheless
while
absolutely
maintaining
our
reserves
our
restrictions
and
even
our
indignations
we
must
say
that
every
time
we
encounter
man
in
the
infinite
either
well
or
ill
understood
we
feel
ourselves
overpowered
with
respect
there
is
in
the
synagogue
in
the
mosque
in
the
pagoda
in
the
wigwam
a
hideous
side
which
we
execrate
and
a
sublime
side
which
we
adore
what
a
contemplation
for
the
mind
and
what
endless
food
for
thought
is
the
reverberation
of
god
upon
the
human
wall
chapter
ii
the
convent
as
an
historical
fact
from
the
point
of
view
of
history
of
reason
and
of
truth
monasticism
is
condemned
monasteries
when
they
abound
in
a
nation
are
clogs
in
its
circulation
cumbrous
establishments
centres
of
idleness
where
centres
of
labor
should
exist
monastic
communities
are
to
the
great
social
community
what
the
mistletoe
is
to
the
oak
what
the
wart
is
to
the
human
body
their
prosperity
and
their
fatness
mean
the
impoverishment
of
the
country
the
monastic
regime
good
at
the
beginning
of
civilization
useful
in
the
reduction
of
the
brutal
by
the
spiritual
is
bad
when
peoples
have
reached
their
manhood
moreover
when
it
becomes
relaxed
and
when
it
enters
into
its
period
of
disorder
it
becomes
bad
for
the
very
reasons
which
rendered
it
salutary
in
its
period
of
purity
because
it
still
continues
to
set
the
example
claustration
has
had
its
day
cloisters
useful
in
the
early
education
of
modern
civilization
have
embarrassed
its
growth
and
are
injurious
to
its
development
so
far
as
institution
and
formation
with
relation
to
man
are
concerned
monasteries
which
were
good
in
the
tenth
century
questionable
in
the
fifteenth
are
detestable
in
the
nineteenth
the
leprosy
of
monasticism
has
gnawed
nearly
to
a
skeleton
two
wonderful
nations
italy
and
spain
the
one
the
light
the
other
the
splendor
of
europe
for
centuries
and
at
the
present
day
these
two
illustrious
peoples
are
but
just
beginning
to
convalesce
thanks
to
the
healthy
and
vigorous
hygiene
of
1789
alone
the
convent
the
ancient
female
convent
in
particular
such
as
it
still
presents
itself
on
the
threshold
of
this
century
in
italy
in
austria
in
spain
is
one
of
the
most
sombre
concretions
of
the
middle
ages
the
cloister
that
cloister
is
the
point
of
intersection
of
horrors
the
catholic
cloister
properly
speaking
is
wholly
filled
with
the
black
radiance
of
death
the
spanish
convent
is
the
most
funereal
of
all
there
rise
in
obscurity
beneath
vaults
filled
with
gloom
beneath
domes
vague
with
shadow
massive
altars
of
babel
as
high
as
cathedrals
there
immense
white
crucifixes
hang
from
chains
in
the
dark
there
are
extended
all
nude
on
the
ebony
great
christs
of
ivory
more
than
bleeding
bloody
hideous
and
magnificent
with
their
elbows
displaying
the
bones
their
knee
pans
showing
their
integuments
their
wounds
showing
their
flesh
crowned
with
silver
thorns
nailed
with
nails
of
gold
with
blood
drops
of
rubies
on
their
brows
and
diamond
tears
in
their
eyes
the
diamonds
and
rubies
seem
wet
and
make
veiled
beings
in
the
shadow
below
weep
their
sides
bruised
with
the
hair
shirt
and
their
iron
tipped
scourges
their
breasts
crushed
with
wicker
hurdles
their
knees
excoriated
with
prayer
women
who
think
themselves
wives
spectres
who
think
themselves
seraphim
do
these
women
think
no
have
they
any
will
no
do
they
love
no
do
they
live
no
their
nerves
have
turned
to
bone
their
bones
have
turned
to
stone
their
veil
is
of
woven
night
their
breath
under
their
veil
resembles
the
indescribably
tragic
respiration
of
death
the
abbess
a
spectre
sanctifies
them
and
terrifies
them
the
immaculate
one
is
there
and
very
fierce
such
are
the
ancient
monasteries
of
spain
lairs
of
terrible
devotion
caverns
of

the

convent
was
above

the

was
a
flavor
of
the

it
the

locked
up

the

of

unable
to
deny
these
things
have
adopted
the
expedient
of
smiling
at
them
there
has
come
into
fashion
a
strange
and
easy
manner
of
suppressing
the
revelations
of
history
of
invalidating
the
commentaries
of
philosophy
of
eliding
all

decidedly
due

they
are

the
author
of
this
book
has
seen
with
his
own
eyes
eight
leagues
distant
from
brussels
there
are
relics
of
the
middle
ages
there
which
are
attainable
for
everybody
at
the
abbey
of
villers
the
hole
of
the
oubliettes
in
the
middle
of
the

which
was
formerly
the

each
of

has
the
remains
of

a

and
a
grated
opening
which
on
the

is
two
feet
above

a

can

a

on
what

one
can
respect
the
past
monasticism
such
as
it
existed
in
spain
and
such
as
it
still
exists
in
thibet
is
a
sort
of
phthisis
for
civilization
it
stops
life
short
it
simply
depopulates
claustration
castration
it
has
been
the
scourge
of
europe
add
to
this
the
violence
so
often
done
to
the
conscience
the
forced
vocations
feudalism
bolstered
up
by
the
cloister
the
right
of
the
first
born
pouring
the
excess
of
the
family
into
monasticism
the
ferocities
of
which
we
have
just
spoken
the
in
pace
the
closed
mouths
the
walled
up
brains
so
many
unfortunate
minds
placed
in
the
dungeon
of
eternal
vows
the
taking
of
the
habit
the
interment
of
living
souls
add
individual
tortures
to
national
degradations
and
whoever
you
may
be
you
will
shudder
before
the
frock
and
the
veil
those
two
winding
sheets
of
human
devising
nevertheless
at
certain
points
and
in
certain
places
in
spite
of
philosophy
in
spite
of
progress
the
spirit
of
the
cloister
persists
in
the
midst
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
a
singular
ascetic
recrudescence
is
at
this
moment
astonishing
the
civilized
world
the
obstinacy
of
antiquated
institutions
in
perpetuating
themselves
resembles
the
stubbornness
of
the
rancid
perfume
which
should
claim
our
hair
the
pretensions
of
the
spoiled
fish
which
should
persist
in
being
eaten
the
persecution
of
the
child
s
garment
which
should
insist
on
clothing
the
man
the
tenderness
of
corpses
which
should
return
to
embrace
the
living
ingrates
says
the
garment
i
protected
you
in
inclement
weather
why
will
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
me
i
have
just
come
from
the
deep
sea
says
the

i
have
been
a
rose
says
the
perfume
i
have
loved
you
says
the
corpse
i
have
civilized
you
says
the
convent
to
this
there
is
but
one
reply
in
former
days
to
dream
of
the
indefinite
prolongation
of
defunct
things
and
of
the
government
of
men
by
embalming
to
restore
dogmas
in
a
bad
condition
to
regild
shrines
to
patch
up
cloisters
to
rebless
reliquaries
to
refurnish
superstitions
to
revictual
fanaticisms
to
put
new
handles
on
holy
water
brushes
and
militarism
to
reconstitute
monasticism
and
militarism
to
believe
in
the
salvation
of
society
by
the
multiplication
of
parasites
to
force
the
past
on
the
present
this
seems
strange
still
there
are
theorists
who
hold
such
theories
these
theorists
who
are
in
other
respects
people
of
intelligence
have
a
very
simple
process
they
apply
to
the
past
a
glazing
which
they
call
social
order
divine
right
morality
family
the
respect
of
elders
antique
authority
sacred
tradition
legitimacy
religion
and
they
go
about
shouting
look
take
this
honest
people
this
logic
was
known
to
the
ancients
the
soothsayers
practise
it
they
rubbed
a
black
heifer
over
with
chalk
and
said
she
is
white
bos
cretatus
as
for
us
we
respect
the
past
here
and
there
and
we
spare
it
above
all
provided
that
it
consents
to
be
dead
if
it
insists
on
being
alive
we
attack
it
and
we
try
to
kill
it
superstitions
bigotries
affected
devotion
prejudices
those
forms
all
forms
as
they
are
are
tenacious
of
life
they
have
teeth
and
nails
in
their
smoke
and
they
must
be
clasped
close
body
to
body
and
war
must
be
made
on
them
and
that
without
truce
for
it
is
one
of
the
fatalities
of
humanity
to
be
condemned
to
eternal
combat
with
phantoms
it
is
difficult
to
seize
darkness
by
the
throat
and
to
hurl
it
to
the
earth
a
convent
in
france
in
the
broad
daylight
of
the
nineteenth
century
is
a
college
of
owls
facing
the
light
a
cloister
caught
in
the
very
act
of
asceticism
in
the
very
heart
of
the
city
of

and
of

rome
blossoming
out
in
paris
is
an
anachronism
in
ordinary

in
order
to
dissolve
an
anachronism
and
to
cause
it
to
vanish
one
has
only
to
make
it
spell
out
the
date
but
we
are
not
in
ordinary
times
let
us
fight
let
us
fight
but
let
us
make
a
distinction
the
peculiar
property
of
truth
is
never
to
commit
excesses
what
need
has
it
of
exaggeration
there
is
that
which
it
is
necessary
to
destroy
and
there
is
that
which
it
is
simply
necessary
to
elucidate
and
examine
what
a
force
is
kindly
and
serious
examination
let
us
not
apply
a
flame
where
only
a
light
is
required
so
given
the
nineteenth
century
we
are
opposed
as
a
general
proposition
and
among
all
peoples
in
asia
as
well
as
in
europe
in
india
as
well
as
in
turkey
to
ascetic
claustration
whoever
says
cloister
says
marsh
their
putrescence
is
evident
their
stagnation
is
unhealthy
their
fermentation
infects
people
with
fever
and
etiolates
them
their
multiplication
becomes
a
plague
of
egypt
we
cannot
think
without
affright
of
those
lands
where
fakirs
bonzes
santons
greek
monks
marabouts
talapoins
and
dervishes
multiply
even
like
swarms
of
vermin
this
said
the
religious
question
remains
this
question
has
certain
mysterious
almost
formidable
sides
may
we
be
permitted
to
look
at
it
fixedly
chapter
iv
the
convent
from
the
point
of
view
of
principles
men
unite
themselves
and
dwell
in
communities
by
virtue
of
what
right
by
virtue
of
the
right
of
association
they
shut
themselves
up
at
home
by
virtue
of
what
right
by
virtue
of
the
right
which
every
man
has
to
open
or
shut
his
door
they
do
not
come
forth
by
virtue
of
what
right
by
virtue
of
the
right
to
go
and
come
which
implies
the
right
to
remain
at
home
there
at
home
what
do
they
do
they
speak
in
low
tones
they
drop
their
eyes
they
toil
they
renounce
the
world
towns
sensualities
pleasures
vanities
pride
interests
they
are
clothed
in
coarse
woollen
or
coarse
linen
not
one
of
them
possesses
in
his
own
right
anything
whatever
on
entering
there
each
one
who
was
rich
makes
himself
poor
what
he
has
he
gives
to
all
he
who
was
what
is
called
noble
a
gentleman
and
a
lord
is
the
equal
of
him
who
was
a
peasant
the
cell
is
identical
for
all
all
undergo
the
same
tonsure
wear
the
same
frock
eat
the
same
black
bread
sleep
on
the
same
straw
die
on
the
same
ashes
the
same
sack
on
their
backs
the
same
rope
around
their
loins
if
the
decision
has
been
to
go
barefoot
all
go
barefoot
there
may
be
a
prince
among
them
that
prince
is
the
same
shadow
as
the
rest
no
titles
even
family
names
have
disappeared
they
bear
only
first
names
all
are
bowed
beneath
the
equality
of
baptismal
names
they
have
dissolved
the
carnal
family
and
constituted
in
their
community
a
spiritual
family
they
have
no
other
relatives
than
all
men
they
succor
the
poor
they
care
for
the
sick
they
elect
those
whom
they
obey
they
call
each
other
my
brother
you
stop
me
and
exclaim
but
that
is
the
ideal
convent
it
is
sufficient
that
it
may
be
the
possible
convent
that
i
should
take
notice
of
it
thence
it
results
that
in
the
preceding
book
i
have
spoken
of
a
convent
with
respectful
accents
the
middle
ages
cast
aside
asia
cast
aside
the
historical
and
political
question
held
in
reserve
from
the
purely
philosophical
point
of
view
outside
the
requirements
of
militant
policy
on
condition
that
the
monastery
shall
be
absolutely
a
voluntary
matter
and
shall
contain
only
consenting
parties
i
shall
always
consider
a
cloistered
community
with
a
certain
attentive
and
in
some
respects
a
deferential
gravity
wherever
there
is
a
community
there
is
a
commune
where
there
is
a
commune
there
is
right
the
monastery
is
the
product
of
the
formula
equality
fraternity
oh
how
grand
is
liberty
and
what
a
splendid
transfiguration
liberty
suffices
to
transform
the
monastery
into
a
republic
let
us
continue
but
these
men
or
these
women
who
are

what

the
meaning
of
these
words
is
there
an
infinite
beyond

is
that
infinite
there
inherent
permanent
necessarily
substantial
since
it
is
infinite
and
because
if
it
lacked
matter
it
would
be
bounded
necessarily
intelligent
since
it
is
infinite
and
because
if
it
lacked
intelligence
it
would
end
there
does
this
infinite
awaken
in
us
the
idea
of
essence
while
we
can
attribute
to
ourselves
only
the
idea
of
existence
in
other
terms
is
it
not
the
absolute
of
which
we
are
only
the
relative
at
the
same
time
that
there
is
an
infinite
without
us
is
there
not
an
infinite
within
us
are
not
these
two
infinites
what
an

superposed
the

the

venerate
the

such
is
the
law
let

not

ourselves
to
prostrating
ourselves
before
the
tree
of
creation
and
to
the
contemplation
of
its
branches
full
of

we
have
a
duty
to
labor
over
the
human
soul
to
defend
the
mystery
against
the
miracle
to
adore
the
incomprehensible
and
reject
the
absurd
to

turn
your
book
upside
down
and

there
is
as
we
know
a
philosophy
which
denies
the
infinite
there
is
also
a
philosophy
pathologically
classified
which
denies
the
sun
this
philosophy
is
called
blindness
to
erect
a
sense
which
we
lack
into
a
source
of
truth
is
a
fine
blind
man

self
sufficiency
the
curious
thing
is
the
haughty
superior
and
compassionate
airs
which
this
groping
philosophy
assumes
towards
the
philosophy
which
beholds
god
one
fancies
he
hears
a
mole
crying
i
pity
them
with
their
sun
there
are
as
we
know
powerful
and
illustrious
atheists
at
bottom
led
back
to
the
truth
by
their
very
force
they
are
not
absolutely
sure
that
they
are
atheists
it
is
with
them
only
a
question
of
definition
and
in
any
case
if
they
do
not
believe
in
god
being
great
minds
they
prove
god
we
salute
them
as
philosophers
while
inexorably
denouncing
their
philosophy
let
us
go
on
the
remarkable
thing
about
it
is
also
their
facility
in
paying
themselves
off
with
words
a
metaphysical
school
of
the
north
impregnated
to
some
extent
with
fog
has
fancied
that
it
has
worked
a
revolution
in
human
understanding
by
replacing
the
word
force
with
the
word
will
to
say
the
plant
wills
instead
of
the
plant
grows
this
would
be
fecund
in
results
indeed
if
we
were
to
add
the
universe
wills
why
because
it
would
come
to
this
the
plant
wills
therefore
it
has

the
universe
wills
therefore
it
has
a
god
as
for
us
who
however
in
contradistinction
to
this
school
reject
nothing
a
priori
a
will
in
the
plant
accepted
by
this
school
appears
to
us
more
difficult
to
admit
than
a
will
in
the
universe
denied
by
it
to
deny
the
will
of
the
infinite
that
is
to
say
god
is
impossible
on
any
other
conditions
than
a
denial
of
the
infinite
we
have
demonstrated
this
the
negation
of
the
infinite
leads
straight
to
nihilism
everything
becomes
a
mental
conception
with
nihilism
no
discussion
is
possible
for
the
nihilist
logic
doubts
the
existence
of
its
interlocutor
and
is
not
quite
sure
that
it
exists
itself
from
its
point
of
view
it
is
possible
that
it
may
be
for
itself
only
a
mental
conception
only
it
does
not
perceive
that
all
which
it
has
denied
it
admits

the

simply
by
the
utterance
of
the

in

no

which

there
is

there

the
notion
of

to
make

fraternize
in

to
render
them
just
by
this
mysterious
confrontation
such
is
the
function
of
real
philosophy
morality

a
blossoming

it

to

it
is
the
ideal
which
has
the
right
to
say
take
this
it
is
on
this
condition
that
it
ceases
to
be
a
sterile
love
of
science
and
becomes
the
one
and
sovereign
mode
of
human
rallying
and
that
philosophy
herself
is
promoted
to
religion
philosophy
should
not
be
a
corbel
erected
on

upon
it
at
its

without
any

than
that

adjourning

confine
ourselves
to

there

the

where

the

entering
a

it
was
into
this

that
jean

had
as
fauchelevent
expressed
it
fallen
from
the
sky
he
had
scaled
the
wall
of
the
garden
which
formed
the
angle
of
the
rue

that
hymn
of
the
angels
which
he
had
heard
in
the
middle
of
the
night
was
the
nuns
chanting
matins
that
hall
of
which
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
in
the
gloom
was
the

that
phantom
which
he
had
seen
stretched
on
the

was
making

of
which

jean

had
as
we
have
already
seen
supped
on
a
glass
of
wine
and
a
bit
of
cheese
before
a
good
crackling
fire
then
the
only
bed
in
the
hut
being
occupied
by
cosette
each
threw
himself
on
a
truss
of
straw
before
he
shut
his
eyes
jean
valjean
said
i
must
remain
here
henceforth
this
remark
trotted
through
fauchelevent
s
head
all
night
long
to
tell
the
truth
neither
of
them
slept
jean
valjean
feeling
that
he
was
discovered
and
that
javert
was
on
his
scent
understood
that
he
and
cosette
were
lost
if
they
returned
to
paris
then
the
new
storm
which
had
just
burst
upon
him
had
stranded
him
in
this
cloister
jean
valjean
had
henceforth
but
one
thought
to
remain
there
now
for
an
unfortunate
man
in
his
position
this
convent
was
both
the
safest
and
the
most
dangerous
of
places
the
most
dangerous
because
as
no
men
might
enter
there
if
he
were
discovered
it
was
a
flagrant
offence
and
jean
valjean
would
find
but
one
step
intervening
between
the
convent
and
prison
the
safest
because
if
he
could
manage
to
get
himself
accepted
there
and
remain
there
who
would
ever
seek
him
in
such
a
place
to
dwell
in
an
impossible
place
was
safety
on
his
side
fauchelevent
was
cudgelling
his
brains
he
began
by
declaring
to
himself
that
he
understood
nothing
of
the
matter
how
had
m

got
there
when
the
walls
were

of
m
sur
m
and
he
knew
nothing
of
what
had
taken
place
there
father
madeleine
had
an
air
which
discouraged
questions
and
besides
fauchelevent
said
to
himself
one
does
not
question
a
saint
m
madeleine
had
preserved
all
his
prestige
in
fauchelevent
s
eyes
only
from
some
words
which
jean
valjean
had
let
fall
the
gardener
thought
he
could
draw
the
inference
that
m
madeleine
had
probably
become
bankrupt
through
the
hard
times
and
that
he
was
pursued
by
his
creditors
or
that
he
had
compromised
himself
in
some
political
affair
and
was
in
hiding
which
last
did
not
displease
fauchelevent
who
like
many
of
our
peasants
of
the
north
had
an
old
fund
of
bonapartism
about
him
while
in
hiding
m
madeleine
had
selected
the
convent
as
a
refuge
and
it
was
quite
simple
that
he
should
wish
to
remain
there
but
the
inexplicable
point
to
which
fauchelevent
returned
constantly
and
over
which
he
wearied
his
brain
was
that
m
madeleine
should
be
there
and
that
he
should
have
that
little
girl
with
him
fauchelevent
saw
them
touched
them
spoke
to
them
and
still
did
not
believe
it
possible
the
incomprehensible
had
just
made
its
entrance
into
fauchelevent
s
hut
fauchelevent
groped
about
amid
conjectures
and
could
see
nothing
clearly
but
this
m
madeleine
saved
my
life
this
certainty
alone
was
sufficient
and
decided
his
course
he
said
to
himself
it
is
my
turn
now
he
added
in
his
conscience
m
madeleine
did
not
stop
to
deliberate
when
it
was
a
question
of
thrusting
himself
under
the
cart
for
the
purpose
of
dragging
me
out
he
made
up
his
mind
to
save
m
madeleine
nevertheless
he
put
many
questions
to
himself
and
made
himself
divers
replies
after
what
he
did
for
me
would
i
save
him
if
he
were
a
thief
just
the
same
if
he
were
an
assassin
would
i
save
him
just
the
same
since
he
is
a
saint
shall
i
save
him
just
the
same
but
what
a
problem
it
was
to
manage
to
have
him
remain
in
the
convent
fauchelevent
did
not
recoil
in
the
face
of
this
almost
chimerical
undertaking
this
poor
peasant
of
picardy
without
any
other
ladder
than
his
self
devotion
his
good
will
and
a
little
of
that
old
rustic
cunning
on
this
occasion
enlisted
in
the
service
of
a
generous
enterprise
undertook
to
scale
the
difficulties
of
the
cloister
and
the
steep
escarpments
of
the
rule
of
saint
benoit
father
fauchelevent
was
an
old
man
who
had
been
an
egoist
all
his
life
and
who
towards
the
end
of
his
days
halt
infirm
with
no
interest
left
to
him
in
the
world
found
it
sweet
to
be
grateful
and
perceiving
a
generous
action
to
be
performed
flung
himself
upon
it
like
a
man
who
at
the
moment
when
he
is
dying
should
find
close
to
his
hand
a
glass
of
good
wine
which
he
had
never
tasted
and
should
swallow
it
with
avidity
we
may
add
that
the
air
which
he
had
breathed
for
many
years
in
this
convent
had
destroyed
all
personality
in
him
and
had
ended
by
rendering
a
good
action
of
some
kind
absolutely
necessary
to
him
so
he
took
his
resolve
to
devote
himself
to
m
madeleine
we
have
just
called
him
a
poor
peasant
of
picardy
that
description
is
just
but
incomplete
at
the
point
of
this
story
which
we
have
now
reached
a
little
of
father
fauchelevent
s
physiology
becomes
useful
he
was
a
peasant
but
he
had
been
a
notary
which
added
trickery
to
his
cunning
and
penetration
to
his
ingenuousness
having
through
various
causes
failed
in
his
business
he
had
descended
to
the
calling
of
a
carter
and
a
laborer
but
in
spite
of
oaths
and
lashings
which
horses
seem
to
require
something
of
the
notary
had
lingered
in
him
he
had
some
natural
wit
he
talked
good
grammar
he
conversed
which
is
a
rare
thing
in
a
village
and
the
other
peasants
said
of
him
he
talks
almost
like
a
gentleman
with
a
hat
fauchelevent
belonged
in
fact
to
that
species
which
the
impertinent
and
flippant
vocabulary
of
the
last
century
qualified
as
demi
bourgeois
demi
lout
and
which
the
metaphors
showered
by
the
chateau
upon
the
thatched
cottage
ticketed
in
the
pigeon
hole
of
the
plebeian
rather
rustic
rather
citified
pepper
and
salt
fauchelevent
though
sorely
tried
and
harshly
used
by
fate
worn
out
a
sort
of
poor
threadbare
old
soul
was
nevertheless
an
impulsive
man
and
extremely
spontaneous
in
his
actions
a
precious
quality
which
prevents
one
from
ever
being
wicked
his
defects
and
his
vices
for
he
had
some
were
all
superficial
in
short
his
physiognomy
was
of
the
kind
which
succeeds
with
an
observer
his
aged
face
had
none
of
those
disagreeable
wrinkles
at
the
top
of
the
forehead
which
signify
malice
or
stupidity
at
daybreak
father
fauchelevent
opened
his
eyes
after
having
done
an
enormous
deal
of
thinking
and
beheld
m
madeleine
seated
on
his
truss
of
straw
and
watching
cosette
s
slumbers
fauchelevent
sat
up
and
said
now
that
you
are
here
how
are
you
going
to
contrive
to
enter
this
remark
summed
up
the
situation
and
aroused
jean
valjean
from
his
revery
the
two
men
took
counsel
together
in
the
first
place
said
fauchelevent
you
will
begin
by
not
setting
foot
outside
of
this
chamber
either
you
or
the
child
one
step
in
the
garden
and
we
are
done
for
that
is
true
monsieur
madeleine
resumed
fauchelevent
you
have
arrived
at
a
very
auspicious
moment
i
mean
to
say
a
very
inauspicious
moment
one
of
the
ladies
is
very
ill
this
will
prevent
them
from
looking
much
in
our
direction
it
seems
that
she
is
dying
the
prayers
of
the
forty
hours
are
being
said
the
whole
community
is
in
confusion
that
occupies
them
the
one
who
is
on
the
point
of
departure
is
a
saint
in
fact
we
are
all
saints
here
all
the
difference
between
them
and
me
is
that
they
say
our
cell
and
that
i
say
my
cabin
the
prayers
for
the
dying
are
to
be
said
and
then
the
prayers
for
the
dead
we
shall
be
at
peace
here
for
to
day
but
i
will
not
answer
for
to
morrow
still
observed
jean
valjean
this
cottage
is
in
the
niche
of
the
wall
it
is
hidden
by
a
sort
of
ruin
there
are
trees
it
is
not
visible
from
the
convent
and
i
add
that
the
nuns
never
come
near
it
well
said
jean
valjean
the
interrogation
mark
which
accentuated
this
well
signified
it
seems
to
me
that
one
may
remain
concealed
here
it
was
to
this
interrogation
point
that
fauchelevent
responded
there
are
the
little
girls
what
little
girls
asked
jean
valjean
just
as
fauchelevent
opened
his
mouth
to
explain
the
words
which
he
had
uttered
a
bell
emitted
one
stroke
the
nun
is
dead
said
he
there
is
the
knell
and
he
made
a
sign
to
jean
valjean
to
listen
the
bell
struck
a
second
time
it
is
the
knell
monsieur
madeleine
the
bell
will
continue
to
strike
once
a
minute
for
twenty
four
hours
until
the
body
is
taken
from
the
church
you
see
they
play
at
recreation
hours
it
suffices
to
have
a
ball
roll
aside
to
send
them
all
hither
in
spite
of
prohibitions
to
hunt
and
rummage
for
it
all
about
here
those
cherubs
are
devils
who
asked
jean
valjean
the
little
girls
you
would
be
very
quickly
discovered
they
would
shriek
oh
a
man
there
is
no
danger
to
day
there
will
be
no
recreation
hour
the
day
will
be
entirely
devoted
to
prayers
you
hear
the
bell
as
i
told
you
a
stroke
each
minute
it
is
the
death
knell
i
understand
father
fauchelevent
there
are
pupils
and
jean
valjean
thought
to
himself
here
is
cosette
s
education
already
provided
fauchelevent
exclaimed
pardine
there
are
little
girls
indeed
and
they
would
bawl
around
you
and
they
would
rush
off
to
be
a
man
here
is
to
have
the
plague
you
see
how
they
fasten
a
bell
to
my
paw
as
though
i
were
a
wild
beast
jean
valjean
fell
into
more
and
more
profound
thought
this
convent
would
be
our
salvation
he
murmured
then
he
raised
his
voice
yes
the
difficulty
is
to
remain
here
no
said
fauchelevent
the
difficulty
is
to
get
out
jean
valjean
felt
the
blood
rush
back
to
his
heart
to
get
out
yes
monsieur
madeleine
in
order
to
return
here
it
is
first
necessary
to
get
out
and
after
waiting
until
another
stroke
of
the
knell
had
sounded
fauchelevent
went
on
you
must
not
be
found
here
in
this
fashion
whence
come
you
for
me
you
fall
from
heaven
because
i
know
you
but
the
nuns
require
one
to
enter
by
the
door
all
at
once
they
heard
a
rather
complicated
pealing
from
another
bell
ah
said
fauchelevent
they
are
ringing
up
the
vocal
mothers
they
are
going
to
the
chapter
they
always
hold
a
chapter
when
any
one
dies
she
died
at
daybreak
people
generally
do
die
at
daybreak
but
cannot
you
get
out
by
the
way
in
which
you
entered
come
i
do
not
ask
for
the
sake
of
questioning
you
but
how
did
you
get
in
jean
valjean
turned
pale
the
very
thought
of
descending
again
into
that
terrible
street
made
him
shudder
you
make
your
way
out
of
a
forest
filled
with
tigers
and
once
out
of
it
imagine
a
friendly
counsel
that
shall
advise
you
to
return
thither
jean
valjean
pictured
to
himself
the
whole
police
force
still
engaged
in
swarming
in
that
quarter
agents
on
the
watch
sentinels
everywhere
frightful
fists
extended
towards
his
collar
javert
at
the
corner
of
the
intersection
of
the
streets
perhaps
impossible
said
he
father
fauchelevent
say
that
i
fell
from
the
sky
but
i
believe
it
i
believe
it
retorted
fauchelevent
you
have
no
need
to
tell
me
that
the
good
god
must
have
taken
you
in
his
hand
for
the
purpose
of
getting
a
good
look
at
you
close
to
and
then
dropped
you
only
he
meant
to
place
you
in
a
man
s
convent
he
made
a
mistake
come
there
goes
another
peal
that
is
to
order
the
porter
to
go
and
inform
the
municipality
that
the
dead
doctor
is
to
come
here
and
view
a
corpse
all
that
is
the
ceremony
of
dying
these
good
ladies
are
not
at
all
fond
of
that
visit
a
doctor
is
a
man
who
does
not
believe
in
anything
he
lifts
the
veil
sometimes
he
lifts
something
else
too
how
quickly
they
have
had
the
doctor
summoned
this
time
what
is
the
matter
your
little
one
is
still
asleep
what
is
her
name
cosette
she
is
your
daughter
you
are
her
grandfather
that
is
yes
it
will
be
easy
enough
for
her
to
get
out
of
here
i
have
my
service
door
which
opens
on
the
courtyard
i
knock
the
porter
opens
i
have
my
vintage
basket
on
my
back
the
child
is
in
it
i
go
out
father
fauchelevent
goes
out
with
his
basket
that
is
perfectly
natural
you
will
tell
the
child
to
keep
very
quiet
she
will
be
under
the
cover
i
will
leave
her
for
whatever
time
is
required
with
a
good
old
friend
a
fruit
seller
whom
i
know
in
the
rue
chemin
vert
who
is
deaf
and
who
has
a
little
bed
i
will
shout
in
the
fruit
seller
s
ear
that
she
is
a
niece
of
mine
and
that
she
is
to
keep
her
for
me
until
to
morrow
then
the
little
one
will
re
enter
with
you
for
i
will
contrive
to
have
you
re
enter
it
must
be
done
but
how
will
you
manage
to
get
out
jean
valjean
shook
his
head
no
one
must
see
me
the
whole
point
lies
there
father
fauchelevent
find
some
means
of
getting
me
out
in
a
basket
under
cover
like
cosette
fauchelevent
scratched
the
lobe
of
his
ear
with
the
middle
finger
of
his
left
hand
a
sign
of
serious
embarrassment
a
third
peal
created
a
diversion
that
is
the
dead
doctor
taking
his
departure
said
fauchelevent
he
has
taken
a
look
and
said
she
is
dead
that
is
well
when
the
doctor
has
signed
the
passport
for
paradise
the
undertaker
s
company
sends
a
coffin
if
it
is
a
mother
the
mothers
lay
her
out
if
she
is
a
sister
the
sisters
lay
her
out
after
which
i
nail
her
up
that
forms
a
part
of
my
gardener
s
duty
a
gardener
is
a
bit
of
a
grave
digger
she
is
placed
in
a
lower
hall
of
the
church
which
communicates
with
the
street
and
into
which
no
man
may
enter
save
the
doctor
of
the
dead
i
don
t
count
the
undertaker
s
men
and
myself
as
men
it
is
in
that
hall
that
i
nail
up
the
coffin
the
undertaker
s
men
come
and
get
it
and
whip
up
coachman
that
s
the
way
one
goes
to
heaven
they
fetch
a
box
with
nothing
in
it
they
take
it
away
again
with
something
in
it
that
s
what
a
burial
is
like
de
profundis
a
horizontal
ray
of
sunshine
lightly
touched
the
face
of
the
sleeping
cosette
who
lay
with
her
mouth
vaguely
open
and
had
the
air
of
an
angel
drinking
in
the
light
jean
valjean
had
fallen
to
gazing
at
her
he
was
no
longer
listening
to
fauchelevent
that
one
is
not
listened
to
is
no
reason
for
preserving
silence
the
good
old
gardener
went
on
tranquilly
with
his
babble
the
grave
is
dug
in
the
vaugirard
cemetery
they
declare
that
they
are
going
to
suppress
that
vaugirard
cemetery
it
is
an
ancient
cemetery
which
is
outside
the
regulations
which
has
no
uniform
and
which
is
going
to
retire
it
is
a
shame
for
it
is
convenient
i
have
a
friend
there
father
mestienne
the
grave
digger
the
nuns
here
possess
one
privilege
it
is
to
be
taken
to
that
cemetery
at
nightfall
there
is
a
special
permission
from
the
prefecture
on
their
behalf
but
how
many
events
have
happened
since
yesterday
mother
crucifixion
is
dead
and
father
madeleine
is
buried
said
jean
valjean
smiling
sadly
fauchelevent
caught
the
word
goodness
if
you
were
here
for
good
it
would
be
a
real
burial
a
fourth
peal
burst
out
fauchelevent
hastily
detached
the
belled
knee
cap
from
its
nail
and
buckled
it
on
his
knee
again
this
time
it
is
for
me
the
mother
prioress
wants
me
good
now
i
am
pricking
myself
on
the
tongue
of
my
buckle
monsieur
madeleine
don
t
stir
from
here
and
wait
for
me
something
new
has
come
up
if
you
are
hungry
there
is
wine
bread
and
cheese
and
he
hastened
out
of
the
hut
crying
coming
coming
jean
valjean
watched
him
hurrying
across
the
garden
as
fast
as
his
crooked
leg
would
permit
casting
a
sidelong
glance
by
the
way
on
his
melon
patch
less
than
ten
minutes
later
father
fauchelevent
whose
bell
put
the
nuns
in
his
road
to
flight
tapped
gently
at
a
door
and
a
gentle
voice
replied
forever
forever
that
is
to
say
enter
the
door
was
the
one
leading
to
the
parlor
reserved
for
seeing
the
gardener
on
business
this
parlor
adjoined
the
chapter
hall
the
prioress
seated
on
the
only
chair
in
the
parlor
was
waiting
for
fauchelevent
chapter
ii
fauchelevent
in
the
presence
of
a
difficulty
it
is
the
peculiarity
of
certain
persons
and
certain
professions
notably
priests
and
nuns
to
wear
a
grave
and
agitated
air
on
critical
occasions
at
the
moment
when
fauchelevent
entered
this
double
form
of
preoccupation
was
imprinted
on
the
countenance
of
the
prioress
who
was
that
wise
and
charming
mademoiselle
de
blemeur
mother
innocente
who
was
ordinarily
cheerful
the
gardener
made
a
timid
bow
and
remained
at
the
door
of
the
cell
the
prioress
who
was
telling
her
beads
raised
her
eyes
and
said
ah
it
is
you
father
fauvent
this
abbreviation
had
been
adopted
in
the
convent
fauchelevent
bowed
again
father
fauvent
i
have
sent
for
you
here
i
am
reverend
mother
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
and
so
have
i
said
fauchelevent
with
a
boldness
which
caused
him
inward
terror
i
have
something
to
say
to
the
very
reverend
mother
the
prioress
stared
at
him
ah
you
have
a
communication
to
make
to
me
a
request
very
well
speak
goodman
fauchelevent
the
ex
notary
belonged
to
the
category
of
peasants
who
have
assurance
a
certain
clever
ignorance
constitutes
a
force
you
do
not
distrust
it
and
you
are
caught
by
it
fauchelevent
had
been
a
success
during
the
something
more
than
two
years
which
he
had
passed
in
the
convent
always
solitary
and
busied
about
his
gardening
he
had
nothing
else
to
do
than
to
indulge
his
curiosity
as
he
was
at
a
distance
from
all
those
veiled
women
passing
to
and
fro
he
saw
before
him
only
an
agitation
of
shadows
by
dint
of
attention
and
sharpness
he
had
succeeded
in
clothing
all
those
phantoms
with
flesh
and
those
corpses
were
alive
for
him
he
was
like
a
deaf
man
whose
sight
grows
keener
and
like
a
blind
man
whose
hearing
becomes
more
acute
he
had
applied
himself
to
riddling
out
the
significance
of
the
different
peals
and
he
had
succeeded
so
that
this
taciturn
and
enigmatical
cloister
possessed
no
secrets
for
him
the
sphinx
babbled
all
her
secrets
in
his
ear
fauchelevent
knew
all
and
concealed
all
that
constituted
his
art
the
whole
convent
thought
him
stupid
a
great
merit
in
religion
the
vocal
mothers
made
much
of
fauchelevent
he
was
a
curious
mute
he
inspired
confidence
moreover
he
was
regular
and
never
went
out
except
for
well
demonstrated
requirements
of
the
orchard
and
vegetable
garden
this
discretion
of
conduct
had
inured
to
his
credit
none
the
less
he
had
set
two
men
to
chattering
the
porter
in
the
convent
and
he
knew
the
singularities
of
their
parlor
and
the
grave
digger
at
the
cemetery
and
he
was
acquainted
with
the
peculiarities
of
their
sepulture
in
this
way
he
possessed
a
double
light
on
the
subject
of
these
nuns
one
as
to
their
life
the
other
as
to
their
death
but
he
did
not
abuse
his
knowledge
the
congregation
thought
a
great
deal
of
him
old
lame
blind
to
everything
probably
a
little
deaf
into
the
bargain
what
qualities
they
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
replace
him
the
goodman
with
the
assurance
of
a
person
who
feels
that
he
is
appreciated
entered
into
a
rather
diffuse
and
very
deep
rustic
harangue
to
the
reverend
prioress
he
talked
a
long
time
about
his
age
his
infirmities
the
surcharge
of
years
counting
double
for
him
henceforth
of
the
increasing
demands
of
his
work
of
the
great
size
of
the
garden
of
nights
which
must
be
passed
like
the
last
for
instance
when
he
had
been
obliged
to
put
straw
mats
over
the
melon
beds
because
of
the
moon
and
he
wound
up
as
follows
that
he
had
a
brother
the
prioress
made
a
movement
a
brother
no
longer
young
a
second
movement
on
the
part
of
the
prioress
but
one
expressive
of
reassurance
that
if
he
might
be
permitted
this
brother
would
come
and
live
with
him
and
help
him
that
he
was
an
excellent
gardener
that
the
community
would
receive
from
him
good
service
better
than
his
own
that
otherwise
if
his
brother
were
not
admitted
as
he
the
elder
felt
that
his
health
was
broken
and
that
he
was
insufficient
for
the
work
he
should
be
obliged
greatly
to
his
regret
to
go
away
and
that
his
brother
had
a
little
daughter
whom
he
would
bring
with
him
who
might
be
reared
for
god
in
the
house
and
who
might
who
knows
become
a
nun
some
day
when
he
had
finished
speaking
the
prioress
stayed
the
slipping
of
her
rosary
between
her
fingers
and
said
to
him
could
you
procure
a
stout
iron
bar
between
now
and
this
evening
for
what
purpose
to
serve
as
a
lever
yes
reverend
mother
replied
fauchelevent
the
prioress
without
adding
a
word
rose
and
entered
the
adjoining
room
which
was
the
hall
of
the
chapter
and
where
the
vocal
mothers
were
probably
assembled
fauchelevent
was
left
alone
chapter
iii
mother
innocente
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
elapsed
the
prioress
returned
and
seated
herself
once
more
on
her
chair
the
two
interlocutors
seemed
preoccupied
we
will
present
a
stenographic
report
of
the
dialogue
which
then
ensued
to
the
best
of
our
ability
father
fauvent
reverend
mother
do
you
know
the
chapel
i
have
a
little
cage
there
where
i
hear
the
mass
and
the
offices
and
you
have
been
in
the
choir
in
pursuance
of
your
duties
two
or
three
times
there
is
a
stone
to
be
raised
heavy
the
slab
of
the
pavement
which
is
at
the
side
of
the
altar
the
slab
which
closes
the
vault
yes
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
have
two
men
for
it
mother
ascension
who
is
as
strong
as
a
man
will
help
you
a
woman
is
never
a
man
we
have
only
a
woman
here
to
help
you
each
one
does
what
he
can
because
dom
mabillon
gives
four
hundred
and
seventeen
epistles
of
saint
bernard
while
merlonus
horstius
only
gives
three
hundred
and
sixty
seven
i
do
not
despise
merlonus
horstius
neither
do
i
merit
consists
in
working
according
to
one
s
strength
a
cloister
is
not
a
dock
yard
and
a
woman
is
not
a
man
but
my
brother
is
the
strong
one
though
and
can
you
get
a
lever
that
is
the
only
sort
of
key
that
fits
that
sort
of
door
there
is
a
ring
in
the
stone
i
will
put
the
lever
through
it
and
the
stone
is
so
arranged
that
it
swings
on
a
pivot
that
is
good
reverend
mother
i
will
open
the
vault
and
the
four
mother
precentors
will
help
you
and
when
the
vault
is
open
it
must
be
closed
again
will
that
be
all
no
give
me
your
orders
very
reverend
mother
fauvent
we
have
confidence
in
you
i
am
here
to
do
anything
you
wish
and
to
hold
your
peace
about
everything
yes
reverend
mother
when
the
vault
is
open
i
will
close
it
again
but
before
that
what
reverend
mother
something
must
be
lowered
into
it
a
silence
ensued
the
prioress
after
a
pout
of
the
under
lip
which
resembled
hesitation
broke
it
father
fauvent
reverend
mother
you
know
that
a
mother
died
this
morning
no
did
you
not
hear
the
bell
nothing
can
be
heard
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
really
i
can
hardly
distinguish
my
own
signal
she
died
at
daybreak
and
then
the
wind
is
not
blowing
in
my
direction
this
morning
it
was
mother
crucifixion
a
blessed
woman
the
prioress
paused
moved
her
lips
as
though
in
mental
prayer
and
resumed
three
years
ago
madame
de
bethune
a
jansenist
turned
orthodox
merely
from
having
seen
mother
crucifixion
at
prayer
ah
yes
now
i
hear
the
knell
reverend
mother
the
mothers
have
taken
her
to
the
dead
room
which
opens
on
the
church
i
know
no
other
man
than
you
can
or
must
enter
that
chamber
see
to
that
a
fine
sight
it
would
be
to
see
a
man
enter
the
dead
room
more
often
hey
more
often
what
do
you
say
i
say
more
often
more
often
than
what
reverend
mother
i
did
not
say
more
often
than
what
i
said
more
often
i
don
t
understand
you
why
do
you
say
more
often
in
order
to
speak
like
you
reverend
mother
but
i
did
not
say
more
often
at
that
moment
nine
o
clock
struck
at
nine
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
at
all
hours
praised
and
adored
be
the
most
holy
sacrament
of
the
altar
said
the
prioress
amen
said
fauchelevent
the
clock
struck
opportunely
it
cut
more
often
short
it
is
probable
that
had
it
not
been
for
this
the
prioress
and
fauchelevent
would
never
have
unravelled
that
skein
fauchelevent
mopped
his
forehead
the
prioress
indulged
in
another
little
inward
murmur
probably
sacred
then
raised
her
voice
in
her
lifetime
mother
crucifixion
made
converts
after
her
death
she
will
perform
miracles
she
will
replied
father
fauchelevent
falling
into
step
and
striving
not
to
flinch
again
father
fauvent
the
community
has
been
blessed
in
mother
crucifixion
no
doubt
it
is
not
granted
to
every
one
to
die
like
cardinal
de
berulle
while
saying
the
holy
mass
and
to
breathe
forth
their
souls
to
god
while
pronouncing
these
words
hanc
igitur
oblationem
but
without
attaining
to
such
happiness
mother
crucifixion
s
death
was
very
precious
she
retained
her
consciousness
to
the
very
last
moment
she
spoke
to
us
then
she
spoke
to
the
angels
she
gave
us
her
last
commands
if
you
had
a
little
more
faith
and
if
you
could
have
been
in
her
cell
she
would
have
cured
your
leg
merely
by
touching
it
she
smiled
we
felt
that
she
was
regaining
her
life
in
god
there
was
something
of
paradise
in
that
death
fauchelevent
thought
that
it
was
an
orison
which
she
was
finishing
amen
said
he
father
fauvent
what
the
dead
wish
must
be
done
the
prioress
took
off
several
beads
of
her
chaplet
fauchelevent
held
his
peace
she
went
on
i
have
consulted
upon
this
point
many
ecclesiastics
laboring
in
our
lord
who
occupy
themselves
in
the
exercises
of
the
clerical
life
and
who
bear
wonderful
fruit
reverend
mother
you
can
hear
the
knell
much
better
here
than
in
the
garden
besides
she
is
more
than
a
dead
woman
she
is
a
saint
like
yourself
reverend
mother
she
slept
in
her
coffin
for
twenty
years
by
express
permission
of
our
holy
father
pius
vii
the
one
who
crowned
the
emp
buonaparte
for
a
clever
man
like
fauchelevent
this
allusion
was
an
awkward
one
fortunately
the
prioress
completely
absorbed
in
her
own
thoughts
did
not
hear
it
she
continued
father
fauvent
reverend
mother
saint
didorus
archbishop
of
cappadocia
desired
that
this
single
word
might
be
inscribed
on
his
tomb
acarus
which
signifies
a
worm
of
the
earth
this
was
done
is
this
true
yes
reverend
mother
the
blessed
mezzocane
abbot
of
aquila
wished
to
be
buried
beneath
the
gallows
this
was
done
that
is
true
saint
terentius
bishop
of
port
where
the
mouth
of
the
tiber
empties
into
the
sea
requested
that
on
his
tomb
might
be
engraved
the
sign
which
was
placed
on
the
graves
of
parricides
in
the
hope
that
passers
by
would
spit
on
his
tomb
this
was
done
the
dead
must
be
obeyed
so
be
it
the
body
of
bernard
guidonis
born
in
france
near
roche
abeille
was
as
he
had
ordered
and
in
spite
of
the
king
of
castile
borne
to
the
church
of
the
dominicans
in
limoges
although
bernard
guidonis
was
bishop
of
tuy
in
spain
can
the
contrary
be
affirmed
for
that
matter
no
reverend
mother
the
fact
is
attested
by
plantavit
de
la
fosse
several
beads
of
the
chaplet
were
told
off
still
in
silence
the
prioress
resumed
father
fauvent
mother
crucifixion
will
be
interred
in
the
coffin
in
which
she
has
slept
for
the
last
twenty
years
that
is
just
it
is
a
continuation
of
her
slumber
so
i
shall
have
to
nail
up
that
coffin
yes
and
we
are
to
reject
the
undertaker
s
coffin
precisely
i
am
at
the
orders
of
the
very
reverend
community
the
four
mother
precentors
will
assist
you
in
nailing
up
the
coffin
i
do
not
need
them
no
in
lowering
the
coffin
where
into
the
vault
what
vault
under
the
altar
fauchelevent
started
the
vault
under
the
altar
under
the
altar
but
you
will
have
an
iron
bar
yes
but
you
will
raise
the
stone
with
the
bar
by
means
of
the
ring
but
the
dead
must
be
obeyed
to
be
buried
in
the
vault
under
the
altar
of
the
chapel
not
to
go
to
profane
earth
to
remain
there
in
death
where
she
prayed
while
living
such
was
the
last
wish
of
mother
crucifixion
she
asked
it
of
us
that
is
to
say
commanded
us
but
it
is
forbidden
forbidden
by
men
enjoined
by
god
what
if
it
became
known
we
have
confidence
in
you
oh
i
am
a
stone
in
your
walls
the
chapter
assembled
the
vocal
mothers
whom
i
have
just
consulted
again
and
who
are
now
deliberating
have
decided
that
mother
crucifixion
shall
be
buried
according
to
her
wish
in
her
own
coffin
under
our
altar
think
father
fauvent
if
she
were
to
work
miracles
here
what
a
glory
of
god
for
the
community
and
miracles
issue
from
tombs
but
reverend
mother
if
the
agent
of
the

to
be
buried

is
to

fauchelevent

imperturbably
extricated
himself
in
this
manner
from
the
dilemma
whenever
he
heard
latin
any
audience
suffices
for
a
person
who
has
held
his

passer
by
who
would
not
be
indignant
to
see
how
we
are
treated
we
have
not
even
the
right
to
give
our
dust
to
jesus
christ
your
sanitary
department
is
a
revolutionary
invention
god
subordinated
to
the
commissary
of
police
such
is
the
age
silence
fauvent
fauchelevent
was
but
ill
at
ease
under
this
shower
bath
the
prioress
continued
no
one
doubts
the
right
of
the
monastery
to
sepulture
only
fanatics
and
those
in
error
deny
it
we
live
in
times
of
terrible
confusion
we
do
not
know
that
which
it
is
necessary
to
know
and
we
know
that
which
we
should
ignore
we
are
ignorant
and
impious
in
this
age
there
exist
people
who
do
not
distinguish
between
the
very
great
saint
bernard
and
the
saint
bernard
denominated
of
the
poor
catholics
a
certain
good
ecclesiastic
who
lived
in
the
thirteenth
century
others
are
so
blasphemous
as
to
compare
the
scaffold
of
louis
xvi
to
the
cross
of
jesus
christ
louis
xvi
was
merely
a
king
let
us
beware
of
god
there
is
no
longer
just
nor
unjust
the
name
of
voltaire
is
known
but
not
the
name
of
cesar
de
bus
nevertheless
cesar
de
bus
is
a
man
of
blessed
memory
and
voltaire
one
of
unblessed
memory
the
last
arch
bishop
the
cardinal

to

senault
the
name
of
father
coton
is
known
not
because
he
was
one
of
the
three
who
urged
the
foundation
of
the
oratorie
but
because
he
furnished
henri
iv
the
huguenot
king
with
the
material
for
an
oath
that
which
pleases
people
of
the
world
in
saint
franã
ois
de
sales
is
that
he
cheated
at
play
and
then
religion
is
attacked
why
because
there
have
been
bad
priests
because
sagittaire
bishop
of
gap
was
the
brother
of
salone
bishop
of
embrun
and
because
both
of
them
followed
mommol
what
has
that
to
do
with
the
question
does
that
prevent
martin

from
being
a

and
giving
half
of

they
persecute
the

they
shut
their

to
the

darkness

the

no

thinks

oh
how
wicked

by

one
no

knows
what

horrible
saint

wrote
two
special
letters
one
to
pierre

the
other
to
the
king
of
the
visigoths
for
the
purpose
of
combating
and
rejecting
in
questions
touching
the
dead
the
authority
of
the
exarch
and
the
supremacy
of
the
emperor
gauthier
bishop
of
chalons
held
his
own
in
this
matter
against
otho
duke
of
burgundy
the
ancient
magistracy
agreed
with
him
in
former
times
we
had
voices
in
the
chapter
even
on
matters
of
the
day
the
abbot
of
citeaux
the
general
of
the
order
was
councillor
by
right
of
birth
to
the
parliament
of

we
do
what
we
please
with
our
dead
is
not
the
body
of
saint
benoit
himself
in
france
in
the
abbey
of
fleury
called
saint

sur

died
in

at

on
saturday
the
21st
of
the
month
of
march
of
the
year
543
all
this
is
incontestable
i
abhor
psalm
singers
i
hate
priors
i
execrate
heretics
but
i
should
detest
yet
more
any
one
who
should
maintain
the
contrary
one
has
only
to
read
arnoul
wion
gabriel
bucelin
trithemus
maurolics
and
dom

the
prioress
took
breath
then
turned
to
fauchelevent
is
it
settled
father
fauvent
it
is
settled
reverend
mother
we
may
depend
on
you
i
will
obey
that
is
well
i
am
entirely
devoted
to
the
convent
that
is
understood
you
will
close
the
coffin
the
sisters
will
carry
it
to
the
chapel
the
office
for
the
dead
will
then
be
said
then
we
shall
return
to
the
cloister
between
eleven
o
clock
and
midnight
you
will
come
with
your
iron
bar
all
will
be
done
in
the
most
profound
secrecy
there
will
be
in
the
chapel
only
the
four
mother
precentors
mother
ascension
and
yourself
and
the
sister
at
the
post
she
will
not
turn
round
but
she
will
hear
she
will
not
listen
besides
what
the
cloister
knows
the
world
learns
not
a
pause
ensued
the
prioress
went
on
you
will
remove
your
bell
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
sister
at
the
post
should
perceive
your
presence
reverend
mother
what
father
fauvent
has
the
doctor
for
the
dead
paid
his
visit
he
will
pay
it
at
four
o
clock
to
day
the
peal
which
orders
the
doctor
for
the
dead
to
be
summoned
has
already
been
rung
but
you
do
not
understand
any
of
the
peals
i
pay
no
attention
to
any
but
my
own
that
is
well
father
fauvent
reverend
mother
a
lever
at
least
six
feet
long
will
be
required
where
will
you
obtain
it
where
gratings
are
not
lacking
iron
bars
are
not
lacking
i
have
my
heap
of
old
iron
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
before
midnight
do
not
forget
reverend
mother
what
if
you
were
ever
to
have
any
other
jobs
of
this
sort
my
brother
is
the
strong
man
for
you
a
perfect
turk
you
will
do
it
as
speedily
as
possible
i
cannot
work
very
fast
i
am
infirm
that
is
why
i
require
an
assistant
i
limp
to
limp
is
no
sin
and
perhaps
it
is
a
blessing
the
emperor
henry
ii
who
combated
antipope
gregory
and
re
established
benoit
viii
has
two
surnames
the
saint
and
the
lame
two
surtouts
are
a
good
thing
murmured
fauchelevent
who
really
was
a
little
hard
of
hearing
now
that
i
think
of
it
father
fauvent
let
us
give
a
whole
hour
to
it
that
is
not
too
much
be
near
the
principal
altar
with
your
iron
bar
at
eleven
o
clock
the
office
begins
at
midnight
everything
must
have
been
completed
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
before
that
i
will
do
anything
to
prove
my
zeal
towards
the
community
these
are
my
orders
i
am
to
nail
up
the
coffin
at
eleven
o
clock
exactly
i
am
to
be
in
the
chapel
the
mother
precentors
will
be
there
mother
ascension
will
be
there
two
men
would
be
better
however
never
mind
i
shall
have
my
lever
we
will
open
the
vault
we
will
lower
the
coffin
and
we
will
close
the
vault
again
after
which
there
will
be
no
trace
of
anything
the
government
will
have
no
suspicion
thus
all
has
been
arranged
reverend
mother
no
what
else
remains
the
empty
coffin
remains
this
produced
a
pause
fauchelevent
meditated
the
prioress
meditated
what
is
to
be
done
with
that
coffin
father
fauvent
it
will
be
given
to
the
earth
empty
another
silence
fauchelevent
made
with
his
left
hand
that
sort
of
a
gesture
which
dismisses
a
troublesome
subject
reverend
mother
i
am
the
one
who
is
to
nail
up
the
coffin
in
the
basement
of
the
church
and
no
one
can
enter
there
but
myself
and
i
will
cover
the
coffin
with
the
pall
yes
but
the
bearers
when
they
place
it
in
the
hearse
and
lower
it
into
the
grave
will
be
sure
to
feel
that
there
is
nothing
in
it
ah
the
de
exclaimed
fauchelevent
the
prioress
began
to
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
looked
fixedly
at
the
gardener
the
vil
stuck
fast
in
his
throat
he
made
haste
to
improvise
an
expedient
to
make
her
forget
the
oath
i
will
put
earth
in
the
coffin
reverend
mother
that
will
produce
the
effect
of
a
corpse
you
are
right
earth
that
is
the
same
thing
as
man
so
you
will
manage
the
empty
coffin
i
will
make
that
my
special
business
the
prioress
s
face
up
to
that
moment
troubled
and
clouded
grew
serene
once
more
she
made
the
sign
of
a
superior
dismissing
an
inferior
to
him
fauchelevent
went
towards
the
door
as
he
was
on
the
point
of
passing
out
the
prioress
raised
her
voice
gently
i
am
pleased
with
you
father
fauvent
bring
your
brother
to
me
to
morrow
after
the
burial
and
tell
him
to
fetch
his
daughter
chapter
iv
in
which
jean
valjean
has
quite
the
air
of
having
read
austin
castillejo
the
strides
of
a
lame
man
are
like
the
ogling
glances
of
a
one
eyed
man
they
do
not
reach
their
goal
very
promptly
moreover
fauchelevent
was
in
a
dilemma
he
took
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
return
to
his
cottage
in
the
garden
cosette
had
waked
up
jean
valjean
had
placed
her
near
the
fire
at
the
moment
when
fauchelevent
entered
jean
valjean
was
pointing
out
to
her
the
vintner
s
basket
on
the
wall
and
saying
to
her
listen
attentively
to
me
my
little
cosette
we
must
go
away
from
this
house
but
we
shall
return
to
it
and
we
shall
be
very
happy
here
the
good
man
who
lives
here
is
going
to
carry
you
off
on
his
back
in
that
you
will
wait
for
me
at
a
lady
s
house
i
shall
come
to
fetch
you
obey
and
say
nothing
above
all
things
unless
you
want
madame
thenardier
to
get
you
again
cosette
nodded
gravely
jean
valjean
turned
round
at
the
noise
made
by
fauchelevent
opening
the
door
well
everything
is
arranged
and
nothing
is
said
fauchelevent
i
have
permission
to
bring
you
in
but
before
bringing
you
in
you
must
be
got
out
that
s
where
the
difficulty
lies
it
is
easy
enough
with
the
child
you
will
carry
her
out
and
she
will
hold
her
tongue
i
answer
for
that
but
you
father
madeleine
and
after
a
silence
fraught
with
anxiety
fauchelevent
exclaimed
why
get
out
as
you
came
in
jean
valjean
as
in
the
first
instance
contented
himself
with
saying
impossible
fauchelevent
grumbled
more
to
himself
than
to
jean
valjean
there
is
another
thing
which
bothers
me
i
have
said
that
i
would
put
earth
in
it
when
i
come
to
think
it
over
the
earth
instead
of
the
corpse
will
not
seem
like
the
real
thing
it
won
t
do
it
will
get
displaced
it
will
move
about
the
men
will
bear
it
you
understand
father
madeleine
the
government
will
notice
it
jean
valjean
stared
him
straight
in
the
eye
and
thought
that
he
was
raving
fauchelevent
went
on
how
the
de
uce
are
you
going
to
get
out
it
must
all
be
done
by
to
morrow
morning
it
is
to
morrow
that
i
am
to
bring
you
in
the
prioress
expects
you
then
he
explained
to
jean
valjean
that
this
was
his
recompense
for
a
service
which
he
fauchelevent
was
to
render
to
the
community
that
it
fell
among
his
duties
to
take
part
in
their
burials
that
he
nailed
up
the
coffins
and
helped
the
grave
digger
at
the
cemetery
that
the
nun
who
had
died
that
morning
had
requested
to
be
buried
in
the
coffin
which
had
served
her
for
a
bed
and
interred
in
the
vault
under
the
altar
of
the
chapel
that
the
police
regulations
forbade
this
but
that
she
was
one
of
those
dead
to
whom
nothing
is
refused
that
the
prioress
and
the
vocal
mothers
intended
to
fulfil
the
wish
of
the
deceased
that
it
was
so
much
the
worse
for
the
government
that
he
fauchelevent
was
to
nail
up
the
coffin
in
the
cell
raise
the
stone
in
the
chapel
and
lower
the
corpse
into
the
vault
and
that
by
way
of
thanks
the
prioress
was
to
admit
his
brother
to
the
house
as
a
gardener
and
his
niece
as
a
pupil
that
his
brother
was
m
madeleine
and
that
his
niece
was
cosette
that
the
prioress
had
told
him
to
bring
his
brother
on
the
following
evening
after
the
counterfeit
interment
in
the
cemetery
but
that
he
could
not
bring
m
madeleine
in
from
the
outside
if
m
madeleine
was
not
outside
that
that
was
the
first
problem
and
then
that
there
was
another
the
empty
coffin
what
is
that
empty
coffin
asked
jean
valjean
fauchelevent
replied
the
coffin
of
the
administration
what
coffin
what
administration
a
nun
dies
the
municipal
doctor
comes
and
says
a
nun
has
died
the
government
sends
a
coffin
the
next
day
it
sends
a
hearse
and
undertaker
s
men
to
get
the
coffin
and
carry
it
to
the
cemetery
the
undertaker
s
men
will
come
and
lift
the
coffin
there
will
be
nothing
in
it
put
something
in
it
a
corpse
i
have
none
no
what
then
a
living
person
what
person
me
said
jean
valjean
fauchelevent
who
was
seated
sprang
up
as
though
a
bomb
had
burst
under
his
chair
you
why
not
jean
valjean
gave
way
to
one
of
those
rare
smiles
which
lighted
up
his
face
like
a
flash
from
heaven
in
the
winter
you
know
fauchelevent
what
you
have
said
mother
crucifixion
is
dead
and
i
add
and
father
madeleine
is
buried
ah
good
you
can
laugh
you
are
not
speaking
seriously
very
seriously
i
must
get
out
of
this
place
certainly
l
have
told
you
to
find
a
basket
and
a
cover
for
me
also
well
the
basket
will
be
of
pine
and
the
cover
a
black
cloth
in
the
first
place
it
will
be
a
white
cloth
nuns
are
buried
in
white
let
it
be
a
white
cloth
then
you
are
not
like
other
men
father
madeleine
to
behold
such
devices
which
are
nothing
else
than
the
savage
and
daring
inventions
of
the
galleys
spring
forth
from
the
peaceable
things
which
surrounded
him
and
mingle
with
what
he
called
the
petty
course
of
life
in
the
convent
caused
fauchelevent
as
much
amazement
as
a
gull
fishing
in
the
gutter
of
the
rue
saint
denis
would
inspire
in
a
passer
by
jean
valjean
went
on
the
problem
is
to
get
out
of
here
without
being
seen
this
offers
the
means
but
give
me
some
information
in
the
first
place
how
is
it
managed
where
is
this
coffin
the
empty
one
yes
down
stairs
in
what
is
called
the
dead
room
it
stands
on
two
trestles
under
the
pall
how
long
is
the
coffin
six
feet
what
is
this
dead
room
it
is
a
chamber
on
the
ground
floor
which
has
a
grated
window
opening
on
the
garden
which
is
closed
on
the
outside
by
a
shutter
and
two
doors
one
leads
into
the
convent
the
other
into
the
church
what
church
the
church
in
the
street
the
church
which
any
one
can
enter
have
you
the
keys
to
those
two
doors
no
i
have
the
key
to
the
door
which
communicates
with
the
convent
the
porter
has
the
key
to
the
door
which
communicates
with
the
church
when
does
the
porter
open
that
door
only
to
allow
the
undertaker
s
men
to
enter
when
they
come
to
get
the
coffin
when
the
coffin
has
been
taken
out
the
door
is
closed
again
who
nails
up
the
coffin
i
do
who
spreads
the
pall
over
it
i
do
are
you
alone
not
another
man
except
the
police
doctor
can
enter
the
dead
room
that
is
even
written
on
the
wall
could
you
hide
me
in
that
room
to
night
when
every
one
is
asleep
no
but
i
could
hide
you
in
a
small
dark
nook
which
opens
on
the
dead
room
where
i
keep
my
tools
to
use
for
burials
and
of
which
i
have
the
key
at
what
time
will
the
hearse
come
for
the
coffin
to
morrow
about
three
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
the
burial
will
take
place
at
the
vaugirard
cemetery
a
little
before
nightfall
it
is
not
very
near
i
will
remain
concealed
in
your
tool
closet
all
night
and
all
the
morning
and
how
about
food
i
shall
be
hungry
i
will
bring
you
something
you
can
come
and
nail
me
up
in
the
coffin
at
two
o
clock
fauchelevent
recoiled
and
cracked
his
finger
joints
but
that
is
impossible
bah
impossible
to
take
a
hammer
and
drive
some
nails
in
a
plank
what
seemed
unprecedented
to
fauchelevent
was
we
repeat
a
simple
matter
to
jean
valjean
jean
valjean
had
been
in
worse
straits
than
this
any
man
who
has
been
a
prisoner
understands
how
to
contract
himself
to
fit
the
diameter
of
the
escape
the
prisoner
is
subject
to
flight
as
the
sick
man
is
subject
to
a
crisis
which
saves
or
kills
him
an
escape
is
a
cure
what
does
not
a
man
undergo
for
the
sake
of
a
cure
to
have
himself
nailed
up
in
a
case
and
carried
off
like
a
bale
of
goods
to
live
for
a
long
time
in
a
box
to
find
air
where
there
is
none
to
economize
his
breath
for
hours
to
know
how
to
stifle
without
dying
this
was
one
of
jean
valjean
s
gloomy
talents
moreover
a
coffin
containing
a
living
being
that
convict
s
expedient
is
also
an
imperial
expedient
if
we
are
to
credit
the
monk
austin
castillejo
this
was
the
means
employed
by
charles
the
fifth
desirous
of
seeing
the
plombes
for
the
last
time
after
his
abdication
he
had
her
brought
into
and
carried
out
of
the
monastery
of
saint
yuste
in
this
manner
fauchelevent
who
had
recovered
himself
a
little
exclaimed
but
how
will
you
manage
to
breathe
i
will
breathe
in
that
box
the
mere
thought
of
it
suffocates
me
you
surely
must
have
a
gimlet
you
will
make
a
few
holes
here
and
there
around
my
mouth
and
you
will
nail
the
top
plank
on
loosely
good
and
what
if
you
should
happen
to
cough
or
to
sneeze
a
man
who
is
making
his
escape
does
not
cough
or
sneeze
and
jean
valjean
added
father
fauchelevent
we
must
come
to
a
decision
i
must
either
be
caught
here
or
accept
this
escape
through
the
hearse
every
one
has
noticed
the
taste
which
cats
have
for
pausing
and
lounging
between
the
two
leaves
of
a
half
shut
door
who
is
there
who
has
not
said
to
a
cat
do
come
in
there
are
men
who
when
an
incident
stands
half
open
before
them
have
the
same
tendency
to
halt
in
indecision
between
two
resolutions
at
the
risk
of
getting
crushed
through
the
abrupt
closing
of
the
adventure
by
fate
the
over
prudent
cats
as
they
are
and
because
they
are
cats
sometimes
incur
more
danger
than
the
audacious
fauchelevent
was
of
this
hesitating
nature
but
jean
valjean
s
coolness
prevailed
over
him
in
spite
of
himself
he
grumbled
well
since
there
is
no
other
means
jean
valjean
resumed
the
only
thing
which
troubles
me
is
what
will
take
place
at
the
cemetery
that
is
the
very
point
that
is
not
troublesome
exclaimed
fauchelevent
if
you
are
sure
of
coming
out
of
the
coffin
all
right
i
am
sure
of
getting
you
out
of
the
grave
the
grave
digger
is
a
drunkard
and
a
friend
of
mine
he
is
father
mestienne
an
old
fellow
of
the
old
school
the
grave
digger
puts
the
corpses
in
the
grave
and
i
put
the
grave
digger
in
my
pocket
i
will
tell
you
what
will
take
place
they
will
arrive
a
little
before
dusk
three
quarters
of
an
hour
before
the
gates
of
the
cemetery
are
closed
the
hearse
will
drive
directly
up
to
the
grave
i
shall
follow
that
is
my
business
i
shall
have
a
hammer
a
chisel
and
some
pincers
in
my
pocket
the
hearse
halts
the
undertaker
s
men
knot
a
rope
around
your
coffin
and
lower
you
down
the
priest
says
the
prayers
makes
the
sign
of
the
cross
sprinkles
the
holy
water
and
takes
his
departure
i
am
left
alone
with
father
mestienne
he
is
my
friend
i
tell
you
one
of
two
things
will
happen
he
will
either
be
sober
or
he
will
not
be
sober
if
he
is
not
drunk
i
shall
say
to
him
come
and
drink
a
bout
while
the
bon
coing
the
good
quince
is
open
i
carry
him
off
i
get
him
drunk
it
does
not
take
long
to
make
father
mestienne
drunk
he
always
has
the
beginning
of
it
about
him
i
lay
him
under
the
table
i
take
his
card
so
that
i
can
get
into
the
cemetery
again
and
i
return
without
him
then
you
have
no
longer
any
one
but
me
to
deal
with
if
he
is
drunk
i
shall
say
to
him
be
off
i
will
do
your
work
for
you
off
he
goes
and
i
drag
you
out
of
the
hole
jean
valjean
held
out
his
hand
and
fauchelevent
precipitated
himself
upon
it
with
the
touching
effusion
of
a
peasant
that
is
settled
father
fauchelevent
all
will
go
well
provided
nothing
goes
wrong
thought
fauchelevent
in
that
case
it
would
be
terrible
chapter
v
it
is
not
necessary
to
be
drunk
in
order
to
be
immortal
on
the
following
day
as
the
sun
was
declining
the
very
rare
passers
by
on
the
boulevard
du
maine
pulled
off
their
hats
to
an
old
fashioned
hearse
ornamented
with
skulls
cross
bones
and
tears
this
hearse
contained
a
coffin
covered
with
a
white
cloth
over
which
spread
a
large
black
cross
like
a
huge
corpse
with
drooping
arms
a
mourning
coach
in
which
could
be
seen
a
priest
in
his
surplice
and
a
choir
boy
in
his
red
cap
followed
two
undertaker
s
men
in
gray
uniforms
trimmed
with
black
walked
on
the
right
and
the
left
of
the
hearse
behind
it
came
an
old
man
in
the
garments
of
a
laborer
who
limped
along
the
procession
was
going
in
the
direction
of
the
vaugirard
cemetery
the
handle
of
a
hammer
the
blade
of
a
cold
chisel
and
the
antennae
of
a
pair
of
pincers
were
visible
protruding
from
the
man
s
pocket
the
vaugirard
cemetery
formed
an
exception
among
the
cemeteries
of
paris
it
had
its
peculiar
usages
just
as
it
had
its
carriage
entrance
and
its
house
door
which
old
people
in
the
quarter
who
clung
tenaciously
to
ancient
words
still
called
the
porte
cavaliere
and
the
porte
pietonne
16
the
bernardines
benedictines
of
the
rue
petit
picpus
had
obtained
permission
as
we
have
already
stated
to
be
buried
there
in
a
corner
apart
and
at
night
the
plot
of
land
having
formerly
belonged
to
their
community
the
grave
diggers
being
thus
bound
to
service
in
the
evening
in
summer
and
at
night
in
winter
in
this
cemetery
they
were
subjected
to
a
special
discipline
the
gates
of
the
paris
cemeteries
closed
at
that
epoch
at
sundown
and
this
being
a
municipal
regulation
the
vaugirard
cemetery
was
bound
by
it
like
the
rest
the
carriage
gate
and
the
house
door
were
two
contiguous
grated
gates
adjoining
a
pavilion
built
by
the
architect
perronet
and
inhabited
by
the
door
keeper
of
the
cemetery
these
gates
therefore
swung
inexorably
on
their
hinges
at
the
instant
when
the
sun
disappeared
behind
the
dome
of
the
invalides
if
any
grave
digger
were
delayed
after
that
moment
in
the
cemetery
there
was
but
one
way
for
him
to
get
out
his
grave
digger
s
card
furnished
by
the
department
of
public
funerals
a
sort
of
letter
box
was
constructed
in
the
porter
s
window
the
grave
digger
dropped
his
card
into
this
box
the
porter
heard
it
fall
pulled
the
rope
and
the
small
door
opened
if
the
man
had
not
his
card
he
mentioned
his
name
the
porter
who
was
sometimes
in
bed
and
asleep
rose
came
out
and
identified
the
man
and
opened
the
gate
with
his
key
the
grave
digger
stepped
out
but
had
to
pay
a
fine
of
fifteen
francs
this
cemetery
with
its
peculiarities
outside
the
regulations
embarrassed
the
symmetry
of
the
administration
it
was
suppressed
a
little
later
than
1830
the
cemetery
of
mont
parnasse
called
the
eastern
cemetery
succeeded
to
it
and
inherited
that
famous
dram
shop
next
to
the
vaugirard
cemetery
which
was
surmounted
by
a
quince
painted
on
a
board
and
which
formed
an
angle
one
side
on
the
drinkers
tables
and
the
other
on
the
tombs
with
this
sign
au
bon
coing
the
vaugirard
cemetery
was
what
may
be
called
a
faded
cemetery
it
was
falling
into
disuse
dampness
was
invading
it
the
flowers
were
deserting
it
the
bourgeois
did
not
care
much
about
being
buried
in
the
vaugirard
it
hinted
at
poverty
pere
lachaise
if
you
please
to
be
buried
in
pere
lachaise
is
equivalent
to
having
furniture
of
mahogany
it
is
recognized
as
elegant
the
vaugirard
cemetery
was
a
venerable
enclosure
planted
like
an
old
fashioned
french
garden
straight
alleys
box
thuya
trees
holly
ancient
tombs
beneath
aged
cypress
trees
and
very
tall
grass
in
the
evening
it
was
tragic
there
there
were
very
lugubrious
lines
about
it
the
sun
had
not
yet
set
when
the
hearse
with
the
white
pall
and
the
black
cross
entered
the
avenue
of
the
vaugirard
cemetery
the
lame
man
who
followed
it
was
no
other
than
fauchelevent
the
interment
of
mother
crucifixion
in
the
vault
under
the
altar
the
exit
of
cosette
the
introduction
of
jean
valjean
to
the
dead
room
all
had
been
executed
without
difficulty
and
there
had
been
no
hitch
let
us
remark
in
passing
that
the
burial
of
mother
crucifixion
under
the
altar
of
the
convent
is
a
perfectly
venial
offence
in
our
sight
it
is
one
of
the
faults
which
resemble
a
duty
the
nuns
had
committed
it
not
only
without
difficulty
but
even
with
the
applause
of
their
own
consciences
in
the
cloister
what
is
called
the
government
is
only
an
intermeddling
with
authority
an
interference
which
is
always
questionable
in
the
first
place
the
rule
as
for
the
code
we
shall
see
make
as
many
laws
as
you
please
men
but
keep
them
for
yourselves
the
tribute
to
caesar
is
never
anything
but
the
remnants
of
the
tribute
to
god
a
prince
is
nothing
in
the
presence
of
a
principle
fauchelevent
limped
along
behind
the
hearse
in
a
very
contented
frame
of
mind
his
twin
plots
the
one
with
the
nuns
the
one
for
the
convent
the
other
against
it
the
other
with
m
madeleine
had
succeeded
to
all
appearance
jean
valjean
s
composure
was
one
of
those
powerful
tranquillities
which
are
contagious
fauchelevent
no
longer
felt
doubtful
as
to
his
success
what
remained
to
be
done
was
a
mere
nothing
within
the
last
two
years
he
had
made
good
father
mestienne
a
chubby
cheeked
person
drunk
at
least
ten
times
he
played
with
father
mestienne
he
did
what
he
liked
with
him
he
made
him
dance
according
to
his
whim
mestienne
s
head
adjusted
itself
to
the
cap
of
fauchelevent
s
will
fauchelevent
s
confidence
was
perfect
at
the
moment
when
the
convoy
entered
the
avenue
leading
to
the
cemetery
fauchelevent
glanced
cheerfully
at
the
hearse
and
said
half
aloud
as
he
rubbed
his
big
hands
here
s
a
fine
farce
all
at
once
the
hearse
halted
it
had
reached
the
gate
the
permission
for
interment
must
be
exhibited
the
undertaker
s
man
addressed
himself
to
the
porter
of
the
cemetery
during
this
colloquy
which
always
is
productive
of
a
delay
of
from
one
to
two
minutes
some
one
a
stranger
came
and
placed
himself
behind
the
hearse
beside
fauchelevent
he
was
a
sort
of
laboring
man
who
wore
a
waistcoat
with
large
pockets
and
carried
a
mattock
under
his
arm
fauchelevent
surveyed
this
stranger
who
are
you
he
demanded
the
man
replied
the
grave
digger
if
a
man
could
survive
the
blow
of
a
cannon
ball
full
in
the
breast
he
would
make
the
same
face
that
fauchelevent
made
the
grave
digger
yes
you
i
father
mestienne
is
the
grave
digger
he
was
what
he
was
he
is
dead
fauchelevent
had
expected
anything
but
this
that
a
grave
digger
could
die
it
is
true
nevertheless
that
grave
diggers
do
die
themselves
by
dint
of
excavating
graves
for
other
people
one
hollows
out
one
s
own
fauchelevent
stood
there
with
his
mouth
wide
open
he
had
hardly
the
strength
to
stammer
but
it
is
not
possible
it
is
so
but
he
persisted
feebly
father
mestienne
is
the
grave
digger
after
napoleon
louis

after
mestienne
gribier
peasant
my
name
is
gribier
fauchelevent
who
was
deadly
pale
stared
at
this
gribier
he
was
a
tall
thin
livid
utterly
funereal
man
he
had
the
air
of
an
unsuccessful
doctor
who
had
turned
grave
digger
fauchelevent
burst
out
laughing
ah
said
he
what
queer
things
do
happen
father
mestienne
is
dead
but
long
live
little
father
lenoir
do
you
know
who
little

is
he
is

of

surene
ah
so
old
mestienne
is
dead
i
am
sorry
for
it
he
was
a
jolly
fellow
but
you
are
a
jolly
fellow
too
are
you
not
comrade
we
ll
go
and
have
a
drink
together
presently
the
man
replied
i
have
been
a
student
i
passed
my
fourth
examination
i
never
drink
the
hearse
had
set
out
again
and
was
rolling
up
the
grand
alley
of
the
cemetery
fauchelevent
had
slackened
his
pace
he
limped
more
out
of
anxiety
than
from
infirmity
the
grave
digger
walked
on
in
front
of
him
fauchelevent
passed
the
unexpected
gribier
once
more
in
review
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
though
very
young
have
the
air
of
age
and
who
though
slender
are
extremely
strong
comrade
cried
fauchelevent
the
man
turned
round
i
am
the
convent
grave
digger
my
colleague
said
the
man
fauchelevent
who
was
illiterate
but
very
sharp
understood
that
he
had
to
deal
with
a
formidable
species
of
man
with
a
fine
talker
he
muttered
so
father
mestienne
is
dead
the
man
replied
completely
the
good
god
consulted
his
note
book
which
shows
when
the
time
is
up
it
was
father
mestienne
s
turn
father
mestienne
died
fauchelevent
repeated
mechanically
the
good
god
the
good
god
said
the
man
authoritatively
according
to
the
philosophers
the
eternal
father
according
to
the
jacobins
the
supreme
being
shall
we
not
make
each
other
s
acquaintance
stammered
fauchelevent
it
is
made
you
are
a
peasant
i
am
a
parisian
people
do
not
know
each
other
until
they
have
drunk
together
he
who
empties
his
glass
empties
his
heart
you
must
come
and
have
a
drink
with
me
such
a
thing
cannot
be
refused
business
first
fauchelevent
thought
i
am
lost
they
were
only
a
few
turns
of
the
wheel
distant
from
the
small
alley
leading
to
the
nuns
corner
the
grave
digger
resumed
peasant
i
have
seven
small
children
who
must
be
fed
as
they
must
eat
i
cannot
drink
and
he
added
with
the
satisfaction
of
a
serious
man
who
is
turning
a
phrase
well
their
hunger
is
the
enemy
of
my
thirst
the
hearse
skirted
a
clump
of
cypress
trees
quitted
the
grand
alley
turned
into
a
narrow
one
entered
the
waste
land
and
plunged
into
a
thicket
this
indicated
the
immediate
proximity
of
the
place
of
sepulture
fauchelevent
slackened
his
pace
but
he
could
not
detain
the
hearse
fortunately
the
soil
which
was
light
and
wet
with
the
winter
rains
clogged
the
wheels
and
retarded
its
speed
he
approached
the
grave
digger
they
have
such
a
nice
little
argenteuil
wine
murmured
fauchelevent
villager
retorted
the
man
i
ought
not
be
a
grave
digger
my
father
was
a
porter
at
the
prytaneum

he

he

i
was

renounce

i
am
still

you

here
a

fauchelevent
whatever
his
anguish
offered
a

but
he
did
not
explain
himself
on

point
who
was
to
pay
generally
fauchelevent
offered

father
mestienne
paid
an
offer
of
a
drink
was
the
evident
result
of
the
novel
situation
created
by
the
new
grave
digger
and
it
was
necessary
to
make
this
offer
but
the
old
gardener
left
the
proverbial
quarter
of
an
hour
named
after
rabelais
in
the
dark
and
that
not
unintentionally
as
for
himself
fauchelevent
did
not
wish
to
pay
troubled
as
he
was
the
grave

went

the

fauchelevent
uneasy
to
the

was
gazing
about
him
on

great
drops

the

halted
the

alighted
from

then
the

one
of
the
small

of
the

had
run
up
a
little
on
a
pile
of

visible

between

who
was
in
the
coffin
the
reader
knows
jean
valjean
jean
valjean
had
arranged
things
so
that
he
could
exist
there
and
he
could
almost
breathe
it
is
a
strange
thing
to
what
a
degree
security
of
conscience
confers
security
of
the
rest
every
combination
thought
out
by
jean
valjean
had
been
progressing
and
progressing
favorably
since
the
preceding
day
he
like
fauchelevent
counted
on
father
mestienne
he
had
no
doubt
as
to
the
end
never
was
there
a
more
critical
situation
never
more
complete
composure
the
four
planks
of
the
coffin
breathe
out
a
kind
of
terrible
peace
it
seemed
as
though
something
of
the
repose
of
the
dead
entered
into
jean
valjean
s
tranquillity
from
the
depths
of
that
coffin
he
had
been
able
to
follow
and
he
had
followed
all
the
phases
of
the
terrible
drama
which
he
was
playing
with
death
shortly
after
fauchelevent
had
finished
nailing
on
the
upper
plank
jean
valjean
had
felt
himself
carried
out
then
driven
off
he
knew
from
the
diminution
in
the
jolting
when
they
left
the
pavements
and
reached
the
earth
road
he
had
divined
from
a
dull
noise
that
they
were
crossing
the
bridge
of
austerlitz
at
the
first
halt
he
had
understood
that
they
were
entering
the
cemetery
at
the
second
halt
he
said
to
himself
here
is
the
grave
suddenly
he
felt
hands
seize
the
coffin
then
a
harsh
grating
against
the
planks
he
explained
it
to
himself
as
the
rope
which
was
being
fastened
round
the
casket
in
order
to
lower
it
into
the
cavity
then
he
experienced
a
giddiness
the
undertaker
s
man
and
the
grave
digger
had
probably
allowed
the
coffin
to
lose
its
balance
and
had
lowered
the
head
before
the
foot
he
recovered
himself
fully
when
he
felt
himself
horizontal
and
motionless
he
had
just
touched
the
bottom
he
had
a
certain
sensation
of
cold
a
voice
rose
above
him
glacial
and
solemn
he
heard
latin
words
which
he
did
not
understand
pass
over
him
so
slowly
that
he
was
able
to
catch
them
one
by
one

terrae

a
child
s
voice
said
de

the
grave
voice
began
again
requiem

ei
domine
the
child
s
voice
responded
et
lux
perpetua
luceat
ei
he
heard
something
like
the
gentle
patter
of
several
drops
of
rain
on
the
plank
which
covered
him
it
was
probably
the
holy
water
he
thought
this
will
be
over
soon
now
patience
for
a
little
while
longer
the
priest
will
take
his
departure
fauchelevent
will
take

off
to

shall
be

then
fauchelevent
will

and
i
shall
get
out
that
will
be
the
work
of
a
good
hour
the
grave
voice
resumed
requiescat
in
pace
and
the
child
s
voice
said
amen
jean
valjean
strained
his
ears
and
heard
something
like
retreating
footsteps
there
they
are
going
now
thought
he
i
am
alone
all
at
once
he
heard
over
his
head
a
sound
which
seemed
to
him
to
be
a
clap
of
thunder
it
was
a
shovelful
of
earth
falling
on
the
coffin
a
second
shovelful
fell
one
of
the
holes
through
which
he
breathed
had
just
been
stopped
up
a
third
shovelful
of
earth
fell
then
a
fourth
there
are
things
which
are
too
strong
for
the
strongest
man
jean
valjean
lost
consciousness
chapter
vii
in
which
will
be
found
the
origin
of
the
saying
don
t
lose
the
card
this
is
what
had
taken
place
above
the
coffin
in
which
lay
jean
valjean
when
the
hearse
had
driven
off
when
the
priest
and
the
choir
boy
had
entered
the
carriage
again
and
taken
their
departure
fauchelevent
who
had
not
taken
his
eyes
from
the
grave
digger
saw
the
latter
bend
over
and
grasp
his
shovel
which
was
sticking
upright
in
the
heap
of
dirt
then
fauchelevent
took
a
supreme
resolve
he
placed
himself
between
the
grave
and
the
grave
digger
crossed
his
arms
and
said
i
am
the
one
to
pay
the
grave
digger
stared
at
him
in
amazement
and
replied
what
s
that
peasant
fauchelevent
repeated
i
am
the
one
who
pays
what
for
the
wine
what
wine
that
argenteuil
wine
where
is
the
argenteuil
at
the
bon
coing
go
to
the
devil
said
the
grave
digger
and
he
flung
a
shovelful
of
earth
on
the
coffin
the
coffin
gave
back
a
hollow
sound
fauchelevent
felt
himself
stagger
and
on
the
point
of
falling
headlong
into
the
grave
himself
he
shouted
in
a
voice
in
which
the
strangling
sound
of
the
death
rattle
began
to
mingle
comrade
before
the
bon
coing
is
shut
the
grave
digger
took
some
more
earth
on
his
shovel
fauchelevent
continued
i
will
pay
and
he
seized
the
man
s
arm
listen
to
me
comrade
i
am
the
convent
grave
digger
i
have
come
to
help
you
it
is
a
business
which
can
be
performed
at
night
let
us
begin
then
by
going
for
a
drink
and
as
he
spoke
and
clung
to
this
desperate
insistence
this
melancholy
reflection
occurred
to
him
and
if
he
drinks
will
he
get
drunk
provincial
said
the
man
if
you
positively
insist
upon
it
i
consent
we
will
drink
after
work
never
before
and
he
flourished
his
shovel
briskly
fauchelevent
held
him
back
it
is
argenteuil
wine
at
six
oh
come
said
the
grave
digger
you
are
a
bell
ringer
ding
dong
ding
dong
that
s
all
you
know
how
to
say
go
hang
yourself
and
he
threw
in
a
second
shovelful
fauchelevent
had
reached
a
point
where
he
no
longer
knew
what
he
was
saying
come
along
and
drink
he
cried
since
it
is
i
who
pays
the
bill
when
we
have
put
the
child
to
bed
said
the
grave
digger
he
flung
in
a
third
shovelful
then
he
thrust
his
shovel
into
the
earth
and
added
it
s
cold
to
night
you
see
and
the
corpse
would
shriek
out
after
us
if
we
were
to
plant
her
there
without
a
coverlet
at
that
moment
as
he
loaded
his
shovel
the
grave
digger
bent
over
and
the
pocket
of
his
waistcoat
gaped
fauchelevent
s
wild
gaze
fell
mechanically
into
that
pocket
and
there
it
stopped
the
sun
was
not
yet
hidden
behind
the
horizon
there
was
still
light
enough
to
enable
him
to
distinguish
something
white
at
the
bottom
of
that
yawning
pocket
the
sum
total
of
lightning
that
the
eye
of
a
picard
peasant
can
contain
traversed
fauchelevent
s
pupils
an
idea
had
just
occurred
to
him
he
thrust
his
hand
into
the
pocket
from
behind
without
the
grave
digger
who
was
wholly
absorbed
in
his
shovelful
of
earth
observing
it
and
pulled
out
the
white
object
which
lay
at
the
bottom
of
it
the
man
sent
a
fourth
shovelful
tumbling
into
the
grave
just
as
he
turned
round
to
get
the
fifth
fauchelevent
looked
calmly
at
him
and
said
by
the
way
you
new
man
have
you
your
card
the
grave
digger
paused
what
card
the
sun
is
on
the
point
of
setting
that
s
good
it
is
going
to
put
on
its
nightcap
the
gate
of
the
cemetery
will
close
immediately
well
what
then
have
you
your
card
ah
my
card
said
the
grave
digger
and
he
fumbled
in
his
pocket
having
searched
one
pocket
he
proceeded
to
search
the
other
he
passed
on
to
his
fobs
explored
the
first
returned
to
the
second
why
no
said
he
i
have
not
my
card

must
have

fauchelevent
the

he
exclaimed
fifteen

three
pieces
of
a
hundred
sous
said
fauchelevent
the
grave
digger
dropped
his
shovel
fauchelevent
s
turn
had
come
ah
come
now
conscript
said
fauchelevent
none
of
this
despair
there
is
no
question
of
committing
suicide
and
benefiting
the
grave
fifteen
francs
is
fifteen
francs
and
besides
you
may
not
be
able
to
pay
it
i
am
an
old

you
are
a
new
one
i
know
all
the
ropes
and
the
devices
i
will
give
you
some
friendly
advice
one
thing
is
clear
the
sun
is
on
the
point
of
setting
it
is
touching
the
dome
now
the
cemetery
will
be
closed
in
five
minutes
more
that
is
true
replied
the
man
five
minutes
more
and
you
will
not
have
time
to
fill
the
grave
it
is
as
hollow
as
the
devil
this
grave
and
to
reach
the
gate
in
season
to
pass
it
before
it
is
shut
that
is
true
in
that
case
a
fine
of
fifteen
francs
fifteen
francs
but
you
have
time
where
do
you
live
a
couple
of
steps
from
the
barrier
a
quarter
of
an
hour
from
here
no
87
rue
de
vaugirard
you
have
just
time
to
get
out
by
taking
to
your
heels
at
your
best
speed
that
is
exactly
so
once
outside
the
gate
you
gallop
home
you
get
your
card
you
return
the
cemetery
porter
admits
you
as
you
have

card
there
will
be
nothing
to
pay
and
you
will
bury
your
corpse
i
ll
watch
it
for
you
in
the
meantime
so
that
it
shall
not
run
away
i
am
indebted
to
you
for
my
life
peasant
decamp
said
fauchelevent
the
grave
digger
overwhelmed
with
gratitude
shook
his
hand
and
set
off
on
a
run
when
the
man
had
disappeared
in
the
thicket
fauchelevent
listened
until
he
heard
his
footsteps
die
away
in
the
distance
then
he
leaned
over
the
grave
and
said
in
a
low
tone
father
madeleine
there
was
no
reply
fauchelevent
was
seized
with
a
shudder
he
tumbled
rather
than
climbed
into
the
grave
flung
himself
on
the
head
of
the
coffin
and
cried
are
you
there
silence
in
the
coffin
fauchelevent
hardly
able
to
draw
his
breath
for
trembling
seized
his
cold
chisel
and
his
hammer
and
pried
up
the
coffin
lid
jean
valjean
s
face
appeared
in
the
twilight
it
was
pale
and
his
eyes
were
closed
fauchelevent
s
hair
rose
upright
on
his
head
he
sprang
to
his
feet
then
fell
back
against
the
side
of
the
grave
ready
to
swoon
on
the
coffin
he
stared
at
jean
valjean
jean
valjean
lay
there
pallid
and
motionless
fauchelevent
murmured
in
a
voice
as
faint
as
a
sigh
he
is
dead
and
drawing
himself
up
and
folding
his
arms
with
such
violence
that
his
clenched
fists
came
in
contact
with
his
shoulders
he
cried
and
this
is
the
way
i
save
his
life
then
the
poor
man
fell
to
sobbing
he
soliloquized
the
while
for
it
is
an
error
to
suppose
that
the
soliloquy
is
unnatural
powerful
emotion
often
talks
aloud
it
is
father
mestienne
s
fault
why
did
that
fool
die
what
need
was
there
for
him
to
give
up
the
ghost
at
the
very
moment
when
no
one
was
expecting
it
it
is
he
who
has
killed
m
madeleine
father
madeleine
he
is
in
the
coffin
it
is
quite
handy
all
is
over
now
is
there
any
sense
in
these
things
ah
my
god
he
is
dead
well
and
his
little
girl
what
am
i
to
do
with
her
what
will
the
fruit
seller
say
the
idea
of
its
being
possible
for
a
man
like
that
to
die
like
this
when
i
think
how
he
put
himself
under
that
cart
father
madeleine
father
madeleine
pardine
he
was
suffocated
i
said
so
he
wouldn
t
believe
me
well
here
s
a
pretty
trick
to
play
he
is
dead
that
good
man
the
very
best
man
out
of
all
the
good
god
s
good
folks
and
his
little
girl
ah
in
the
first
place
i
won
t
go
back
there
myself
i
shall
stay
here
after
having
done
such
a
thing
as
that
what
s
the
use
of
being
two
old
men
if
we
are
two
old
fools
but
in
the
first
place
how
did
he
manage
to
enter
the
convent
that
was
the
beginning
of
it
all
one
should
not
do
such
things
father

he
does
not
hear
me
now
get
out
of
this
scrape
if
you
can
and
he
tore
his
hair
a
grating
sound
became
audible
through
the
trees
in
the
distance
it
was
the
cemetery
gate
closing
fauchelevent
bent
over
jean
valjean
and
all
at
once
he
bounded
back
and
recoiled
so
far
as
the
limits
of
a
grave
permit
jean
valjean
s
eyes
were
open
and
gazing
at
him
to
see
a
corpse
is
alarming
to
behold
a
resurrection
is
almost
as
much
so
fauchelevent
became
like
stone
pale
haggard
overwhelmed
by
all
these
excesses
of
emotion
not
knowing
whether
he
had
to
do
with
a
living
man
or
a
dead
one
and
staring
at
jean
valjean
who
was
gazing
at
him
illustration

resurrection
i
fell
asleep
said
jean
valjean
and
he
raised
himself
to
a
sitting
posture
fauchelevent
fell
on
his
knees
just
good
virgin
how
you
frightened
me
then
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
cried
thanks
father
madeleine
jean
valjean
had
merely
fainted
the
fresh
air
had
revived
him
joy
is
the
ebb
of
terror
fauchelevent
found
almost
as
much
difficulty
in
recovering
himself
as
jean
valjean
had
so
you
are
not
dead
oh
how
wise
you
are
i
called
you
so
much
that
you
came
back
when
i
saw
your
eyes
shut
i
said
good
there
he
is

i
should
have
gone

mad
enough
for
a
strait
jacket
they
would
have
put
me
in
bicetre
what
do
you
suppose
i
should
have
done
if
you
had
been
dead
and
your
little
girl
there
s
that
fruit
seller
she
would
never
have
understood
it
the
child
is
thrust
into
your
arms
and
then
the
grandfather
is
dead
what
a
story
good
saints
of
paradise
what
a
tale
ah
you
are
alive
that
s
the
best
of
it
i
am
cold
said
jean
valjean
this
remark
recalled
fauchelevent
thoroughly
to
reality
and
there
was
pressing
need
of
it
the
souls
of
these
two
men
were
troubled
even
when
they
had
recovered
themselves
although
they
did
not
realize
it
and
there
was
about
them
something
uncanny
which
was
the
sinister
bewilderment
inspired
by
the
place
let
us
get
out
of
here
quickly
exclaimed
fauchelevent
he
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
gourd
with
which
he
had
provided
himself
but
first
take
a
drop
said
he
the
flask
finished
what
the
fresh
air
had
begun
jean
valjean
swallowed
a
mouthful
of
brandy
and
regained
full
possession
of
his
faculties
he
got
out
of
the
coffin
and
helped
fauchelevent
to
nail
on
the
lid
again
three
minutes
later
they
were
out
of
the
grave
moreover
fauchelevent
was
perfectly
composed
he
took
his
time
the
cemetery
was
closed
the
arrival
of
the
grave
digger
gribier
was
not
to
be
apprehended
that
conscript
was
at
home
busily
engaged
in
looking
for
his
card
and
at
some
difficulty
in
finding
it
in
his
lodgings
since
it
was
in
fauchelevent
s
pocket
without
a
card
he
could
not
get
back
into
the
cemetery
fauchelevent
took
the
shovel
and
jean
valjean
the
pick
axe
and
together
they
buried
the
empty
coffin
when
the
grave
was
full
fauchelevent
said
to
jean
valjean
let
us
go
i
will
keep
the
shovel
do
you
carry
off
the
mattock
night
was
falling
jean
valjean
experienced
rome
difficulty
in
moving
and
in
walking
he
had
stiffened
himself
in
that
coffin
and
had
become
a
little
like
a
corpse
the
rigidity
of
death
had
seized
upon
him
between
those
four
planks
he
had
in
a
manner
to
thaw
out
from
the
tomb
you
are
benumbed
said
fauchelevent
it
is
a
pity
that
i
have
a
game
leg
for
otherwise
we
might
step
out
briskly
bah
replied
jean
valjean
four
paces
will
put
life
into
my
legs
once
more
they
set
off
by
the
alleys
through
which
the
hearse
had
passed
on
arriving
before
the
closed
gate
and
the
porter
s
pavilion
fauchelevent
who
held
the
grave
digger
s
card
in
his
hand
dropped
it
into
the
box
the
porter
pulled
the
rope
the
gate
opened
and
they
went
out
how
well
everything
is
going
said
fauchelevent
what
a
capital
idea
that
was
of
yours
father
madeleine
they
passed
the
vaugirard
barrier
in
the
simplest
manner
in
the
world
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
cemetery
a
shovel
and
pick
are
equal
to
two
passports
the
rue
vaugirard
was
deserted
father
madeleine
said
fauchelevent
as
they
went
along
and
raising
his
eyes
to
the
houses
your
eyes
are
better
than
mine
show
me
no
87
here
it
is
said
jean
valjean
there
is
no
one
in
the
street
said
fauchelevent
give
me
your
mattock
and
wait
a
couple
of
minutes
for
me
fauchelevent
entered
no
87
ascended
to
the
very
top
guided
by
the
instinct
which
always
leads
the
poor
man
to
the
garret
and
knocked
in
the
dark
at
the
door
of
an
attic
a
voice
replied
come
in
it
was
gribier
s
voice
fauchelevent
opened
the
door
the
grave
digger
s
dwelling
was
like
all
such
wretched
habitations
an
unfurnished
and
encumbered
garret
a
packing
case
a
coffin
perhaps
took
the
place
of
a
commode
a
butter
pot
served
for
a
drinking
fountain
a
straw
mattress
served
for
a
bed
the
floor
served
instead
of
tables
and
chairs
in
a
corner
on
a
tattered
fragment
which
had
been
a
piece
of
an
old
carpet
a
thin
woman
and
a
number
of
children
were
piled
in
a
heap
the
whole
of
this
poverty
stricken
interior
bore
traces
of
having
been
overturned
one
would
have
said
that
there
had
been
an
earthquake
for
one
the
covers
were
displaced
the
rags
scattered
about
the
jug
broken
the
mother
had
been
crying
the
children
had
probably
been
beaten
traces
of
a
vigorous
and
ill
tempered
search
it
was
plain
that
the
grave
digger
had
made
a
desperate
search
for
his
card
and
had
made
everybody
in
the
garret
from
the
jug
to
his
wife
responsible
for
its
loss
he
wore
an
air
of
desperation
but
fauchelevent
was
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
terminate
this
adventure
to
take
any
notice
of
this
sad
side
of
his
success
he
entered
and
said
i
have
brought
you
back
your
shovel
and
pick
gribier
gazed
at
him
in
stupefaction
is
it
you
peasant
and
to
morrow
morning
you
will
find
your
card
with
the
porter
of
the
cemetery
and
he
laid
the
shovel
and
mattock
on
the
floor
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
demanded
gribier
the
meaning
of
it
is
that
you
dropped
your
card
out
of
your
pocket
that
i
found
it
on
the
ground
after
you
were
gone
that
i
have
buried
the
corpse
that
i
have
filled
the
grave
that
i
have
done
your
work
that
the
porter
will
return
your
card
to
you
and
that
you
will
not
have
to
pay
fifteen
francs
there
you
have
it
conscript
thanks
villager
exclaimed
gribier
radiant
the
next
time
i
will
pay
for
the
drinks

chapter

a
successful
interrogatory
an
hour
later
in
the
darkness
of
night
two
men
and
a
child
presented
themselves
at
no
62
rue
petit
picpus
the
elder
of
the
men
lifted
the
knocker
and
rapped
they
were
fauchelevent
jean
valjean
and
cosette
the
two
old
men
had
gone
to
fetch
cosette
from
the
fruiterer
s
in
the
rue
du
chemin
vert
where
fauchelevent
had
deposited
her
on
the
preceding
day
cosette
had
passed
these
twenty
four
hours
trembling
silently
and
understanding
nothing
she
trembled
to
such
a
degree
that
she
wept
she
had
neither
eaten
nor
slept
the
worthy
fruit
seller
had
plied
her
with
a
hundred
questions
without
obtaining
any
other
reply
than
a
melancholy
and
unvarying
gaze
cosette
had
betrayed
nothing
of
what
she
had
seen
and
heard
during
the
last
two
days
she
divined
that
they
were
passing
through
a
crisis
she
was
deeply
conscious
that
it
was
necessary
to
be
good
who
has
not
experienced
the
sovereign
power
of
those
two
words
pronounced
with
a
certain
accent
in
the
ear
of
a
terrified
little
being
say
nothing
fear
is
mute
moreover
no
one
guards
a
secret
like
a
child
but
when
at
the
expiration
of
these
lugubrious
twenty
four
hours
she
beheld
jean
valjean
again
she
gave
vent
to
such
a
cry
of
joy
that
any
thoughtful
person
who
had
chanced
to
hear
that
cry
would
have
guessed
that
it
issued
from
an
abyss
fauchelevent
belonged
to
the
convent
and
knew
the
pass
words
all
the
doors
opened
thus
was
solved
the
double
and
alarming
problem
of
how
to
get
out
and
how
to
get
in
the
porter
who
had
received
his
instructions
opened
the
little
servant
s
door
which
connected
the
courtyard
with
the
garden
and
which
could
still
be
seen
from
the
street
twenty
years
ago
in
the
wall
at
the
bottom
of
the
court
which
faced
the
carriage
entrance
the
porter
admitted
all
three
of
them
through
this
door
and
from
that
point
they
reached
the
inner
reserved
parlor
where
fauchelevent
on
the
preceding
day
had
received
his
orders
from
the
prioress
the
prioress
rosary
in
hand
was
waiting
for
them
a
vocal
mother
with
her
veil
lowered
stood
beside
her
a
discreet
candle
lighted
one
might
almost
say
made
a
show
of
lighting
the
parlor
the
prioress
passed
jean
valjean
in
review
there
is
nothing
which
examines
like
a
downcast
eye
then
she
questioned
him
you
are
the
brother
yes
reverend
mother
replied
fauchelevent
what
is
your
name
fauchelevent
replied
ultime
fauchelevent
he
really
had
had
a
brother
named
ultime
who
was
dead
where
do
you
come
from
fauchelevent
replied
from
picquigny
near
amiens
what
is
your
age
fauchelevent
replied
fifty
what
is
your
profession
fauchelevent
replied
gardener
are
you
a
good
christian
fauchelevent
replied
every
one
is
in
the
family
is
this
your
little
girl
fauchelevent
replied
yes
reverend
mother
you
are
her
father
fauchelevent
replied
her
grandfather
the
vocal
mother
said
to
the
prioress
in
a
low
voice
he
answers
well
jean
valjean
had
not
uttered
a
single
word
the
prioress
looked
attentively
at
cosette
and
said
half
aloud
to
the
vocal
mother
she
will
grow
up
ugly
the
two
mothers
consulted
for
a
few
moments
in
very
low
tones
in
the
corner
of
the
parlor
then
the
prioress
turned
round
and
said
father
fauvent
you
will
get
another
knee
cap
with
a
bell
two
will
be
required
now
on
the
following
day
therefore
two
bells
were
audible
in
the
garden
and
the
nuns
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
raise
the
corner
of
their
veils
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
garden
under
the
trees
two
men
fauvent
and
another
man
were
visible
as
they
dug
side
by
side
an
enormous
event
their
silence
was
broken
to
the
extent
of
saying
to
each
other
he
is
an
assistant
gardener
the
vocal
mothers
added
he
is
a
brother
of
father
fauvent
jean
valjean
was
in
fact
regularly
installed
he
had
his
belled
knee
cap
henceforth
he
was
official
his
name
was
ultime
fauchelevent
the
most
powerful
determining
cause
of
his
admission
had
been
the
prioress
s
observation
upon
cosette
she
will
grow
up
ugly
the
prioress
that
pronounced
prognosticator
immediately
took
a
fancy
to
cosette
and
gave
her
a
place
in
the
school
as
a
charity
pupil
there
is
nothing
that
is
not
strictly
logical
about
this
it
is
in
vain
that
mirrors
are
banished
from
the
convent
women
are
conscious
of
their
faces
now
girls
who
are
conscious
of
their
beauty
do
not
easily
become
nuns
the
vocation
being
voluntary
in
inverse
proportion
to
their
good
looks
more
is
to
be
hoped
from
the
ugly
than
from
the
pretty
hence
a
lively
taste
for
plain
girls
the
whole
of
this
adventure
increased
the
importance
of
good
old
fauchelevent
he
won
a
triple
success
in
the
eyes
of
jean
valjean
whom
he
had
saved
and
sheltered
in
those
of
grave
digger
gribier
who
said
to
himself
he
spared
me
that
fine
with
the
convent
which
being
enabled
thanks
to
him
to
retain
the
coffin
of
mother
crucifixion
under
the
altar
eluded
caesar
and
satisfied
god
there
was
a
coffin
containing
a
body
in
the
petit
picpus
and
a
coffin
without
a
body
in
the
vaugirard
cemetery
public
order
had
no
doubt
been
deeply
disturbed
thereby
but
no
one
was
aware
of
it
as
for
the
convent
its
gratitude
to
fauchelevent
was
very
great
fauchelevent
became
the
best
of
servitors
and
the
most
precious
of
gardeners
upon
the
occasion
of
the
archbishop
s
next
visit
the
prioress
recounted
the
affair
to
his
grace
making
something
of
a
confession
at
the
same
time
and
yet
boasting
of
her
deed
on
leaving
the
convent
the
archbishop
mentioned
it
with
approval
and
in
a
whisper
to
m
de
latil
monsieur
s
confessor
afterwards
archbishop
of
reims
and
cardinal
this
admiration
for
fauchelevent
became
widespread
for
it
made
its
way
to
rome
we
have
seen
a
note
addressed
by
the
then
reigning
pope
leo
xii
to
one
of
his
relatives
a
monsignor
in
the
nuncio
s
establishment
in
paris
and
bearing
like
himself
the
name
of
della
genga
it
contained
these
lines
it
appears
that
there
is
in
a
convent
in
paris
an
excellent
gardener
who
is
also
a
holy
man
named
fauvent
nothing
of
this
triumph
reached
fauchelevent
in
his
hut
he
went
on
grafting
weeding
and
covering
up
his
melon
beds
without
in
the
least
suspecting
his
excellences
and
his
sanctity
neither
did
he
suspect
his
glory
any
more
than
a
durham
or
surrey
bull
whose
portrait
is
published
in
the
london
illustrated
news
with
this
inscription
bull
which
carried
off
the
prize
at
the

show
chapter
ix
cloistered
cosette
continued
to
hold
her
tongue
in
the
convent
it
was
quite
natural
that
cosette
should
think
herself
jean
valjean
s
daughter
moreover
as
she
knew
nothing
she
could
say
nothing
and
then
she
would
not
have
said
anything
in
any
case
as
we
have
just
observed
nothing
trains
children
to
silence
like
unhappiness
cosette
had
suffered
so
much
that
she
feared
everything
even
to
speak
or
to
breathe
a
single
word
had
so
often
brought
down
an
avalanche
upon
her
she
had
hardly
begun
to
regain
her
confidence
since
she
had
been
with
jean
valjean
she
speedily
became
accustomed
to
the
convent
only
she
regretted
catherine
but
she
dared
not
say
so
once
however
she
did
say
to
jean
valjean
father
if
i
had
known
i
would
have
brought
her
away
with
me
cosette
had
been
obliged
on
becoming
a
scholar
in
the
convent
to
don
the
garb
of
the
pupils
of
the
house
jean
valjean
succeeded
in
getting
them
to
restore
to
him
the
garments
which
she
laid
aside
this
was
the
same
mourning
suit
which
he
had
made
her
put
on
when
she
had
quitted
the
thenardiers
inn
it
was
not
very
threadbare
even
now
jean
valjean
locked
up
these
garments
plus
the
stockings
and
the
shoes
with
a
quantity
of
camphor
and
all
the
aromatics
in
which
convents
abound
in
a
little
valise
which
he
found
means
of
procuring
he
set
this
valise
on
a
chair
near
his
bed
and
he
always
carried
the
key
about
his
person
father
cosette
asked
him
one
day
what
is
there
in
that
box
which
smells
so
good
father
fauchelevent
received
other
recompense
for
his
good
action
in
addition
to
the
glory
which
we
just
mentioned
and
of
which
he
knew
nothing
in
the
first
place
it
made
him
happy
next
he
had
much
less
work
since
it
was
shared
lastly
as
he
was
very
fond
of
snuff
he
found
the
presence
of
m
madeleine
an
advantage
in
that
he
used
three
times
as
much
as
he
had
done
previously
and
that
in
an
infinitely
more
luxurious
manner
seeing
that
m
madeleine
paid
for
it
the
nuns
did
not
adopt
the
name
of
ultime
they
called
jean
valjean
the
other
fauvent
if
these
holy
women
had
possessed
anything
of
javert
s
glance
they
would
eventually
have
noticed
that
when
there
was
any
errand
to
be
done
outside
in
the
behalf
of
the
garden
it
was
always
the
elder
fauchelevent
the
old
the
infirm
the
lame
man
who
went
and
never
the
other
but
whether
it
is
that
eyes
constantly
fixed
on
god
know
not
how
to
spy
or
whether
they
were
by
preference
occupied
in
keeping
watch
on
each
other
they
paid
no
heed
to
this
moreover
it
was
well
for
jean
valjean
that
he
kept
close
and
did
not
stir
out
javert
watched
the
quarter
for
more
than
a
month
this
convent
was
for
jean
valjean
like
an
island
surrounded
by
gulfs
henceforth
those
four
walls
constituted
his
world
he
saw
enough
of
the
sky
there
to
enable
him
to
preserve
his
serenity
and
cosette
enough
to
remain
happy
a
very
sweet
life
began
for
him
he
inhabited
the
old
hut
at
the
end
of
the
garden
in
company
with
fauchelevent
this
hovel
built
of
old
rubbish
which
was
still
in
existence
in
1845
was
composed
as
the
reader
already
knows
of
three
chambers
all
of
which
were
utterly
bare
and
had
nothing
beyond
the
walls
the

the

the

royalist
bank
note
this
specimen
of
vendean
paper
money
had
been
nailed
to
the
wall
by
the
preceding
gardener
an
old
chouan
who
had
died
in
the
convent
and
whose
place
fauchelevent
had
taken
jean
valjean
worked
in
the
garden
every
day
and
made
himself
very
useful
he
had
formerly
been
a
pruner
of
trees
and
he
gladly
found
himself
a
gardener
once
more
it
will
be
remembered
that
he
knew
all
sorts
of
secrets
and
receipts
for
agriculture
he
turned
these
to
advantage
almost
all
the
trees
in
the
orchard
were
ungrafted
and
wild
he
budded
them
and
made
them
produce
excellent
fruit
cosette
had
permission
to
pass
an
hour
with
him
every
day
as
the
sisters
were
melancholy
and
he
was
kind
the
child
made
comparisons
and
adored
him
at
the
appointed
hour
she
flew
to
the
hut
when
she
entered
the
lowly
cabin
she
filled
it
with
paradise
jean
valjean
blossomed
out
and
felt
his
happiness
increase
with
the
happiness
which
he
afforded
cosette
the
joy
which
we
inspire
has
this
charming
property
that
far
from
growing
meagre
like
all
reflections
it
returns
to
us
more
radiant
than
ever
at
recreation
hours
jean
valjean
watched
her
running
and
playing
in
the
distance
and
he
distinguished
her
laugh
from
that
of
the
rest
for
cosette
laughed
now
cosette
s
face
had
even
undergone
a
change
to
a
certain
extent
the
gloom
had
disappeared
from
it
a
smile
is
the
same
as
sunshine
it
banishes
winter
from
the
human
countenance
recreation
over
when
cosette
went
into
the
house
again
jean
valjean
gazed
at
the
windows
of
her
class
room
and
at
night
he
rose
to
look
at
the
windows
of
her
dormitory
god
has
his
own
ways
moreover
the
convent
contributed
like
cosette
to
uphold
and
complete
the
bishop
s
work
in
jean
valjean
it
is
certain
that
virtue
adjoins
pride
on
one
side
a
bridge
built
by
the
devil
exists
there
jean
valjean
had
been
unconsciously
perhaps
tolerably
near
that
side
and
that
bridge
when
providence
cast
his
lot
in
the
convent
of
the
petit
picpus
so
long
as
he
had
compared
himself
only
to
the
bishop
he
had
regarded
himself
as
unworthy
and
had
remained
humble
but
for
some
time
past
he
had
been
comparing
himself
to
men
in
general
and
pride
was
beginning
to
spring
up
who
knows
he
might
have
ended
by
returning
very
gradually
to
hatred
the
convent
stopped
him
on
that
downward
path
this
was
the
second
place
of
captivity
which
he
had
seen
in
his
youth
in
what
had
been
for
him
the
beginning
of
his
life
and
later
on
quite
recently
again
he
had
beheld
another
a
frightful
place
a
terrible
place
whose
severities
had
always
appeared
to
him
the
iniquity
of
justice
and
the
crime
of
the
law
now
after
the
galleys
he
saw
the
cloister
and
when
he
meditated
how
he
had
formed
a
part
of
the
galleys
and
that
he
now
so
to
speak
was
a
spectator
of
the
cloister
he
confronted
the
two
in
his
own
mind
with
anxiety
sometimes
he
crossed
his
arms
and
leaned
on
his
hoe
and
slowly
descended
the
endless
spirals
of
revery
he
recalled
his
former
companions
how
wretched
they
were
they
rose
at
dawn
and
toiled
until
night
hardly
were
they
permitted
to
sleep
they
lay
on
camp
beds
where
nothing
was
tolerated
but
mattresses
two
inches
thick
in
rooms
which
were
heated
only
in
the
very
harshest
months
of
the
year
they
were
clothed
in
frightful
red
blouses
they
were
allowed
as
a
great
favor
linen
trousers
in
the
hottest
weather
and
a
woollen
carter
s
blouse
on
their
backs
when
it
was
very
cold
they
drank
no
wine
and
ate
no
meat
except
when
they
went
on
fatigue
duty
they
lived
nameless
designated
only
by
numbers
and
converted
after
a
manner
into
ciphers
themselves
with
downcast
eyes
with
lowered
voices
with
shorn
heads
beneath
the
cudgel
and
in
disgrace
then
his
mind
reverted
to
the
beings
whom
he
had
under
his
eyes
these
beings
also
lived
with
shorn
heads
with
downcast
eyes
with
lowered
voices
not
in
disgrace
but
amid
the
scoffs
of
the
world
not
with
their
backs
bruised
with
the
cudgel
but
with
their
shoulders
lacerated
with
their
discipline
their
names
also
had
vanished
from
among
men
they
no
longer
existed
except
under
austere
appellations
they
never
ate
meat
and
they
never
drank
wine
they
often
remained
until
evening
without
food
they
were
attired
not
in
a
red
blouse
but
in
a
black
shroud
of
woollen
which
was
heavy
in
summer
and
thin
in
winter
without
the
power
to
add
or
subtract
anything
from
it
without
having
even
according
to
the
season
the
resource
of
the
linen
garment
or
the
woollen
cloak
and
for
six
months
in
the
year
they
wore
serge
chemises
which
gave
them
fever
they
dwelt
not
in
rooms
warmed
only
during
rigorous
cold
but
in
cells
where
no
fire
was
ever
lighted
they
slept
not
on
mattresses
two
inches
thick
but
on
straw
and
finally
they
were
not
even
allowed
their
sleep
every
night
after
a
day
of
toil
they
were
obliged
in
the
weariness
of
their
first
slumber
at
the
moment
when
they
were
falling
sound
asleep
and
beginning
to
get
warm
to
rouse
themselves
to
rise
and
to
go
and
pray
in
an
ice
cold
and
gloomy
chapel
with
their
knees
on
the
stones
on
certain
days
each
of
these
beings
in
turn
had
to
remain
for
twelve
successive
hours
in
a
kneeling
posture
or
prostrate
with
face
upon
the
pavement
and
arms
outstretched
in
the
form
of
a
cross
the
others
were
men
these
were
women
what
had
those
men
done
they
had
stolen
violated
pillaged
murdered
assassinated
they
were
bandits
counterfeiters
poisoners
incendiaries
murderers
parricides
what
had
these
women
done
they
had
done
nothing
whatever
on
the
one
hand
highway
robbery
fraud
deceit
violence
sensuality
homicide
all
sorts
of
sacrilege
every
variety
of
crime
on
the
other
one
thing
only
innocence
perfect
innocence
almost
caught
up
into
heaven
in
a
mysterious
assumption
attached
to
the
earth
by
virtue
already
possessing
something
of
heaven
through
holiness
on
the
one
hand
confidences
over
crimes
which
are
exchanged
in
whispers
on
the
other
the
confession
of
faults
made
aloud
and
what
crimes
and
what
faults
on
the
one
hand
miasms
on
the
other
an
ineffable
perfume
on
the
one
hand
a
moral
pest
guarded
from
sight
penned
up
under
the
range
of
cannon
and
literally
devouring
its
plague
stricken
victims
on
the
other
the
chaste
flame
of
all
souls
on
the
same
hearth
there
darkness
here
the
shadow
but
a
shadow
filled
with
gleams
of
light
and
of
gleams
full
of
radiance
two
strongholds
of
slavery
but
in
the
first
deliverance
possible
a
legal
limit
always
in
sight
and
then
escape
in
the
second
perpetuity
the
sole
hope
at
the
distant
extremity
of
the
future
that
faint
light
of
liberty
which
men
call
death
in
the
first
men
are
bound
only
with
chains
in
the
other
chained
by
faith
what
flowed
from
the
first
an
immense
curse
the
gnashing
of
teeth
hatred
desperate
viciousness
a
cry
of
rage
against
human
society
a
sarcasm
against
heaven
what
results
flowed
from
the
second
blessings
and
love
and
in
these
two
places
so
similar
yet
so
unlike
these
two
species
of
beings
who
were
so
very
unlike
were
undergoing
the
same
work
expiation
jean
valjean
understood
thoroughly
the
expiation
of
the
former
that
personal
expiation
the
expiation
for
one
s
self
but
he
did
not
understand
that
of
these
last
that
of
creatures
without
reproach
and
without
stain
and
he
trembled
as
he
asked
himself
the
expiation
of
what
what
expiation
a
voice
within
his
conscience
replied
the
most
divine
of
human
generosities
the
expiation
for
others
here
all
personal
theory
is
withheld
we
are
only
the
narrator
we
place
ourselves
at
jean
valjean
s
point
of
view
and
we
translate
his
impressions
before
his
eyes
he
had
the
sublime
summit
of
abnegation
the
highest
possible
pitch
of
virtue
the
innocence
which
pardons
men
their
faults
and
which
expiates
in
their
stead
servitude
submitted
to
torture
accepted
punishment
claimed
by
souls
which
have
not
sinned
for
the
sake
of
sparing
it
to
souls
which
have
fallen
the
love
of
humanity
swallowed
up
in
the
love
of
god
but
even
there
preserving
its
distinct
and
mediatorial
character
sweet
and
feeble
beings
possessing
the
misery
of
those
who
are
punished
and
the
smile
of
those
who
are
recompensed
and
he
remembered
that
he
had
dared
to
murmur
often
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
rose
to
listen
to
the
grateful
song
of
those
innocent
creatures
weighed
down
with
severities
and
the
blood
ran
cold
in
his
veins
at
the
thought
that
those
who
were
justly
chastised
raised
their
voices
heavenward
only
in
blasphemy
and
that
he
wretch
that
he
was
had
shaken
his
fist
at
god
there
was
one
striking
thing
which
caused
him
to
meditate
deeply
like
a
warning
whisper
from
providence
itself
the
scaling
of
that
wall
the
passing
of
those
barriers
the
adventure
accepted
even
at
the
risk
of
death
the
painful
and
difficult
ascent
all
those
efforts
even
which
he
had
made
to
escape
from
that
other
place
of
expiation
he
had
made
in
order
to
gain
entrance
into
this
one
was
this
a
symbol
of
his
destiny
this
house
was
a
prison
likewise
and
bore
a
melancholy
resemblance
to
that
other
one
whence
he
had
fled
and
yet
he
had
never
conceived
an
idea
of
anything
similar
again
he
beheld
gratings
bolts
iron
bars
to
guard
whom
angels
these
lofty
walls
which
he
had
seen
around
tigers
he
now
beheld
once
more
around
lambs
this
was
a
place
of
expiation
and
not
of
punishment
and
yet
it
was
still
more
austere
more
gloomy
and
more
pitiless
than
the
other
these
virgins
were
even
more
heavily
burdened
than
the
convicts
a
cold
harsh
wind
that
wind
which
had
chilled
his
youth
traversed
the
barred
and
padlocked
grating
of
the
vultures
a
still
harsher
and
more
biting
breeze
blew
in
the
cage
of
these
doves
why
when
he
thought
on
these
things
all
that
was
within
him
was
lost
in
amazement
before
this
mystery
of
sublimity
in
these
meditations
his
pride
vanished
he
scrutinized
his
own
heart
in
all
manner
of
ways
he
felt
his
pettiness
and
many
a
time
he
wept
all
that
had
entered
into
his
life
for
the
last
six
months
had
led
him
back
towards
the
bishop
s
holy
injunctions
cosette
through
love
the
convent
through
humility
sometimes
at
eventide
in
the
twilight
at
an
hour
when
the
garden
was
deserted
he
could
be
seen
on
his
knees
in
the
middle
of
the
walk
which
skirted
the
chapel
in
front
of
the
window
through
which
he
had
gazed
on
the
night
of
his
arrival
and
turned
towards
the
spot
where
as
he
knew
the
sister
was
making
reparation
prostrated
in
prayer
thus
he
prayed
as
he
knelt
before
the
sister
it
seemed
as
though
he
dared
not
kneel
directly
before
god
everything
that
surrounded
him
that
peaceful
garden
those
fragrant
flowers
those
children
who
uttered
joyous
cries
those
grave
and
simple
women
that
silent
cloister
slowly
permeated
him
and
little
by
little
his
soul
became
compounded
of
silence
like
the
cloister
of
perfume
like
the
flowers
of
simplicity
like
the
women
of
joy
like
the
children
and
then
he
reflected
that
these
had
been
two
houses
of
god
which
had
received
him
in
succession
at
two
critical
moments
in
his
life
the
first
when
all
doors
were
closed
and
when
human
society
rejected
him
the
second
at
a
moment
when
human
society
had
again
set
out
in
pursuit
of
him
and
when
the
galleys
were
again
yawning
and
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
first
he
should
have
relapsed
into
crime
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
second
into
torment
his
whole
heart
melted
in
gratitude
and
he
loved
more
and
more
many
years
passed
in
this
manner
cosette
was
growing
up
